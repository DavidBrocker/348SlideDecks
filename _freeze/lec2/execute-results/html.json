A 0.0 GPA means an F rather than the absence of a grade.\n\n-   Ratio has a 0 that. means 0 (the absence of something), like a '0' as a response to the questions, \"How many drinks did you have last night?\"\n\n## Discrete and Continous\n\n### What's the Difference?\n\n::: fragment\n[Discrete variables]{.bg style=\"--col: #e64173\"} have predefined values\n:::\n\n-   US States\n\n-   Flavors of Ice Cream\n\n::: fragment\n[Continous Variables]{.bg style=\"--col: #e64173\"} can occupy several different values\n:::\n\n-   Reaction Time\n\n-   TV Ratings\n\n## Determining Scale of measurement\n\n### Identify the scale of measurement.\n\n> Undergraduates report their self-esteem on a scale of 1 to 10.
