That’s nominal data. {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n\n\n\n\n{{< fa mug-hot size=5x >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ordinal (Ranked, Uneven Gaps)\n\n### Examples:\n\n-   Rank order of stress: mild / moderate / severe\n-   Olympic medals (gold, silver, bronze)\n-   Likert-style agreement (Strongly Disagree → Strongly Agree) — though technically often treated as interval in practice\n-   Clinical severity ratings (minimal, mild, moderate, severe depression)\n\n# Who’s seen the movie *Inside Out*? Imagine ranking the emotions in order of how often you feel them—Fear first, then Joy, then Anger. That’s ordinal. {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n\n\n\n\n{{< fa face-smile size=5x >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Interval (equal distances, no true zero)\n\n### Examples:\n\n-   IQ scores\n\n-   Standardized test scores (e.g., SAT, GRE)\n\n-   Temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius\n\n-   GPA\n\n# If someone has a GPA of 0.0, does that mean they don’t exist as a student? No—it just means they failed.

Ratio scale. {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n\n\n\n\n{{< fa bed size=5x >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Interval vs Ratio\n\n### What's the difference between interval and ratio?\n\n-   Interval may have a 0 on the scale, but it doesn't mean the absence of something. A 0.0 GPA means an F rather than the absence of a grade.\n\n-   Ratio has a 0 that. means 0 (the absence of something), like a '0' as a response to the questions, \"How many drinks did you have last night?\"\n\n## Discrete and Continuous\n\n### What's the Difference?\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class = slide-deck src=\"https://farmingdale.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8BmvWRKoN0pX36e\" width=\"100%\" height=\"50%\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Discrete and Continuous\n\n### Discrete variables have predefined values\n\n-   **Number of siblings** (you can’t have 2.5 siblings)\n\n-   **Number of errors on a test**\n\n-   **Types of therapy** (CBT, psychoanalysis, none)\n\n-   **Diagnostic category** (depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc.)\n\n-   **Eye color**\n\n-   **Number of cups of coffee consumed today**\n\n## Discrete and Continuous\n\n### Continuous Variables can occupy several different values\n\n-   **Reaction time** (seconds, milliseconds)\n\n-   **Height** (inches, centimeters)\n\n-   **Weight** (pounds, kilograms)\n\n-   **Self-esteem score** on a 1–10 scale\n\n-   **GPA**\n\n-   **Hours of sleep last night** (can be 7.25 hours)\n\n-   **Brain activity** (EEG voltage, fMRI signal intensity)\n\n## Determining Scale of measurement\n\n### Identify the scale of measurement.\n\n> Undergraduates report their self-esteem on a scale of 1 to 10.
