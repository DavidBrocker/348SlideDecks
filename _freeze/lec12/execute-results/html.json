The data are **continuous** (interval or ratio scale).\n2. The sample is **randomly selected**.\n3. The data are **normally distributed** (or the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply).\n\n## The One-Sample t-Test Formula\n\nThe test statistic is calculated as:\n\n$$ t = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}} $$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $\\bar{X}$ = sample mean\n\n- $\\mu$ = population mean (null hypothesis value)\n\n- $s$ = sample standard deviation\n\n- $n$ = sample size\n\n# Example: Exam Scores\n\n## Hypothesis Testing Steps\n1. **Set Hypotheses:**\n   - $H_0$: The average exam score is 75 ($\\mu = 75$).\n   - $H_A$: The average exam score is **not** 75 ($\\mu \\neq 75$).\n2. **Collect Sample Data:**\n   - Sample size: $n = 20$\n   - Sample mean: $\\bar{X} = 78$\n   - Sample standard deviation: $s = 5$\n   \n## Hypothesis Testing Steps\n3. **Compute the t-Statistic:**\n\n$$ t = \\frac{78 - 75}{5 / \\sqrt{20}} = \\frac{3}{1.118} = 2.68 $$\n\n4. **Compare to Critical Value:**\n   - Using a $\\alpha = 0.05$ level and df = 19, critical $t_{.025,19} = \\pm 2.093$.\n   - Since $2.68 > 2.093$, we reject $H_0$.\n\n## Reporting Results\nAPA-style:\n\n> A one-sample t-test was conducted to compare exam scores to the national average of 75. Results showed a significant difference, **t(19) = 2.68, p < .05**, indicating that students scored significantly higher than the national average.\n\n# Interpreting Results\n- A **significant** result ($p < .05$) suggests that the sample mean is different from the population mean.\n- A **non-significant** result ($p > .05$) means we fail to reject $H_0$ (no evidence of a difference).\n\n# Visualizing Data\n\n## Sample Summary Table\n\n| Measure        | Value |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Sample Mean   | 78    |\n| Population Mean | 75    |\n| Sample SD     | 5     |\n| Sample Size   | 20    |\n| t-Statistic   | 2.68  |\n| p-Value       | 0.014 |\n\n## Boxplot Example\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec12_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## üìù **Example 1: Exam Scores vs. National Average**  \n\n### **Scenario**  \nA professor wants to test if students in their class scored **differently** from the national average of 75 on an exam. A sample of **25 students** has a mean score of **78** with a standard deviation of **10**.  \n\n### **Hypotheses**  \n- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: \\( \\mu = 75 \\) (no difference)  \n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: \\( \\mu \\neq 75 \\) (scores differ)  \n\n### **Calculation**  \nUsing the one-sample t-test formula:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting values:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{78 - 75}{10 / \\sqrt{25}} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\n\\]\n\nFor **df = 24**, the critical value at **Œ± = .05** (two-tailed) is **¬±2.064**. Since **1.5 < 2.064**, we **fail to reject \\(H_0\\)**.\n\n### **APA Reporting**  \n*A one-sample t-test was conducted to determine whether students‚Äô exam scores differed from the national average (M = 75). Results were not statistically significant, \\( t(24) = 1.5, p > .05 \\), indicating that students performed similarly to the national average.*  \n\n---\n\n## üìù **Example 2: Daily Coffee Consumption**  \n\n### **Scenario**  \nA coffee company claims that people drink an average of **3 cups** of coffee per day. A researcher samples **16 individuals**, finding a **mean of 2.5 cups** and a **standard deviation of 1 cup**.  \n\n### **Hypotheses**  \n- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: \\( \\mu = 3 \\)  \n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: \\( \\mu < 3 \\) (people drink less)  \n\n### **Calculation**  \n\\[\nt = \\frac{2.5 - 3}{1 / \\sqrt{16}} = \\frac{-0.5}{0.25} = -2.0\n\\]\n\nFor **df = 15**, the critical t-value for a **one-tailed test** at **Œ± = .05** is **-1.753**. Since **-2.0 < -1.753**, we **reject \\(H_0\\)**.\n\n### **APA Reporting**  \n*A one-sample t-test was conducted to test whether daily coffee consumption was lower than the reported average of 3 cups. Results showed a significant difference, \\( t(15) = -2.0, p < .05 \\), suggesting that people consume significantly fewer cups of coffee per day than reported.*  \n\n---\n\n## üìù **Example 3: Sleep Duration Among College Students**  \n\n### **Scenario**  \nA health researcher believes college students sleep **less than 7 hours** per night. A sample of **30 students** reports a mean of **6.5 hours** with a standard deviation of **1.2 hours**.  \n\n### **Hypotheses**  \n- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: \\( \\mu = 7 \\)  \n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: \\( \\mu < 7 \\)  \n\n### **Calculation**  \n\\[\nt = \\frac{6.5 - 7}{1.2 / \\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{-0.5}{0.219} = -2.28\n\\]\n\nFor **df = 29**, the critical t-value for a **one-tailed test** at **Œ± = .05** is **-1.699**. Since **-2.28 < -1.699**, we **reject \\(H_0\\)**.\n\n### **APA Reporting**  \n*A one-sample t-test was conducted to test whether college students sleep fewer than 7 hours per night. Results were statistically significant, \\( t(29) = -2.28, p < .05 \\), indicating that students get significantly less sleep than the recommended amount.*  \n\n\n## Conclusion\n### One Sample T-Test\n- The one-sample t-test is useful for comparing a sample mean to a known population mean.\n- Always check assumptions before conducting the test.\n- Report results in APA format, including effect size if necessary.\n\n\n\n",
