Concept Refresher (5‚Äì10 minutes)\n\nPrompt:\n‚ÄúSometimes we want to know if a group we‚Äôre studying is different from the general population ‚Äî but we only have one group‚Äôs data. The one-sample t-test helps us test whether our sample mean differs significantly from a known or hypothesized mean.‚Äù\n\nExample questions to warm up:\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhat does the t-test compare?\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhat does the null hypothesis say in this context?\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow does sample size affect the t statistic?\n\n## 2. Example Scenario Ideas (Pick one or rotate by section)\n\nEach scenario includes a population mean and invites students to test a claim:\n\nTheme\tScenario\tPopulation Mean (Œº‚ÇÄ)\tVariable Example\nüç´ Fun & Food\tThe average American eats 12 pounds of chocolate per year. Is our class different?\t12\tchocolate_pounds\nüì± Technology\tOn average, college students spend 4 hours/day on their phone. Is our sample higher?\t4\thours_per_day\nüí§ Sleep\tThe CDC recommends 8 hours of sleep per night. Does our sample get less?\t8\tsleep_hours\nüò¨ Anxiety\tNational anxiety scale mean = 50 (SD = 10). Is our class more anxious?\t50\tanxiety_score\n\n## 3. Data Collection (10‚Äì15 minutes)\n\nOption 1: Live data collection\nHave students submit quick responses via Google Form or Qualtrics (e.g., ‚ÄúHow many hours of sleep did you get last night?‚Äù). Export as a .csv.\n\nOption 2: Simulated dataset\nProvide a dataset such as:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## 4. Analysis (15‚Äì20 minutes)\n\nStep 1: State hypotheses\n\t‚Ä¢\tH‚ÇÄ: Œº = Œº‚ÇÄ\n\t‚Ä¢\tH‚ÇÅ: Œº ‚â† Œº‚ÇÄ\n\nStep 2: Run the test in R\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tOne Sample t-test\n\ndata:  sleep_data$sleep_hours\nt = -5.2258, df = 29, p-value = 1.354e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 8\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 6.827916 7.487297\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 7.157607 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nStep 3: Interpret the output\n\t‚Ä¢\tt-value\n\t‚Ä¢\tdf\n\t‚Ä¢\tp-value\n\t‚Ä¢\t95% confidence interval\n\t‚Ä¢\tDirection of difference\n\nStep 4: APA write-up example\n\nStudents in our sample (M = 7.2, SD = 0.9) reported significantly less sleep than the CDC‚Äôs recommended 8 hours, t(29) = -4.67, p < .001.\n\n## 5. Discussion Questions\n\t1.\tWhat does the negative t-value indicate?\n\t2.\tWhat would happen if the sample were larger but had the same mean?\n\t3.\tHow does the confidence interval help confirm your conclusion?\n\t4.\tCan a non-significant result still be meaningful? Why or why not?\n\n## 6. Optional Extension\n\t‚Ä¢\tEffect Size: Calculate Cohen‚Äôs d manually or using:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] -0.9540911\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tVisualization: Show how the sample mean compares to the population mean with a density plot or boxplot.\n\n## Deliverable\n\nA short lab report (or RMarkdown/Quarto doc) including:\n\t1.\tStated hypotheses\n\t2.\tOutput and interpretation\n\t3.\tAPA-style results section\n\t4.\tVisual (optional)\n\t5.\tReflection question: ‚ÄúWhat does your result suggest about your sample?‚Äù\n",
