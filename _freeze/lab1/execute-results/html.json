The research focuses on visual stimuli (e.g., unsettling images) and their impact on self-reported curiosity and arousal levels.\n\n. . .\n\n-   The study uses two groups:\n    -   Participants who view neutral images (e.g., landscapes).\n    -   Participants who view morbidly curious images (e.g., depictions of natural disasters or abandoned locations).\n\n## Writing Exercise\n\nAfter viewing the images, participants rate their curiosity and emotional arousal using a validated 5-point Likert scale.\n\n-   **Participants**\n    -   Who would participate and how they are selected.\n-   **Materials**\n    -   Instruments or tools used for the study.\n-   **Procedure**\n    -   Describe how the study will be conducted.\n\n## Writing Exercise\n\n-   **Design**\n    -   Outline the study design and variables.\n-   **Peer Review**\n    -   Students exchange drafts and give constructive feedback.\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n-   Overgeneralization or lack of specificity.\n-   Omitting key details (e.g., sample size or instrument reliability).\n-   Failing to justify design choices.\n    -   Why *this* sample?\n    -   Why *these* stimuli?\n    -   Why *this* design over another?\n-   Forgetting to mention IRB approval or informed consent.\n-   Using vague descriptions of measures (“a survey”) instead of naming/citing validated instruments.\n\n## Method Section Example\n\n### The Good, Bad, and the Ugly\n\n> **Participants**\n>\n> Some people were in the study. They were college students, I think. Not sure how many, but it was enough.\n>\n> **Materials**\n>\n> We used some pictures and stuff that were kind of gross and some others that weren’t. Also, we had a survey thing but it was just a basic questionnaire.\n>\n> **Procedure**\n>\n> First, participants came to the lab. Then they looked at the pictures. After that, they filled out the survey. It didn’t take too long. They got credit or something.\n>\n> **Design**\n>\n> It was kind of like an experiment but also not really. We compared the groups who saw the different pictures.\n\n## Writing Exercise\n\n### Sample Section\n\n-   Participants: “One hundred twenty undergraduate students (M~age~ = 20.4, 65% female) were recruited through the university participant pool.”\n\n-   Materials: “Stimuli included 20 images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 2008). Participants rated each image on a 5-point curiosity scale.”\n\n-   Procedure:\n\n-   Design\n",
