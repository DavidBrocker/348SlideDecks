-   **Real-World Examples:** We’ll talk about data that actually matters to you.

## Outside of Class

## *Why are we here?*

### To turn confusion into **confidence** and numbers into **knowledge**!

## What is Statistics? 

-   The art of turning data into... **more confusing data** (just kidding!).
-   It's the science of making sense of the world through numbers.

## But Seriously, What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions.

*Translation:*\
"We help people who hate math feel smart with numbers!"

## Why Should You Care? 

-   Because data is everywhere, even in your favorite **Netflix** recommendations!
-   Knowing stats can help you win arguments on the internet with **facts**.
-   It’s like having a superpower—just without the cape.
