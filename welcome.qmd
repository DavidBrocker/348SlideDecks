##  {#int-title}

[Hi, I'm Dave!]{.int-title}

[Welcome to Statistics for Psychology!]{.int-sub}

[Dave Brocker<br>Lecturer<br>Farmingdale State College]{.int-auth}

## Introduction

### Who Am I?

-   **Name**

    -   Professor Dave Brocker

-   **Background**

    -   7+ Years of Teaching Undergraduate Statistics
    -   Researcher/Laboratory Manager
    -   Internship Coordinator

-   **Education**

    -   *Graduate*: M.A. in Experimental Psychology, *CUNY Brooklyn College*.

    -   *Undergraduate*: BS in Applied Psychology, *Farmingdale State College*

## Research

### I'm Always Looking for Research Assistants!

-   **Morbid Curiosity**

    -   *Why are we interested in 'weird' and 'negative' things?*

-   **Creepiness**

    -   *What makes a person 'creepy'?*

-   **Emotion and Morality**

    -   *What makes immoral things disgusting?*

## My Teaching Style

### What Can You Expect?

-   **Humor**

    -   I (try) to be funny, I think it makes the class more enjoyable!

-   **Real-World Examples**

    -   We will use a mixture of real and fabricated data to help illustrate ideas and to show how you what we are discussing relates back to your current and potentially future experiences.

-   **Interactive**

    -   Whenever possible, I favor dynamic content over static content. I want you to be able to see how statistical concepts look and move, rather than appear frozen in space.

## What Are Students Saying?

## How This Class Works

### Course Structure

::: list-dave
-   **Participation:**
    -   Asking questions helps you understand and will likely help out your classmates!
-   **Homework:**
    -   I want you to have practice outside of the classroom (low-stakes)
-   **InQuizitive**:
    -   Textbook Component that measures critical thinking and understanding
-   **Exams:**
    -   An adequate (not perfect) method of seeing how well you understand and can apply the material

## What About AI?

### Use It!

AI tools are everywhere and trying to avoid them or police their use is a bit of a fools errand! This is all I ask:

-   If you use an AI tool (LLM), show me how you used it!

-   Don't let it replace your own thinking\*

-   If you don't know *how* to use it, ask me and we can go over it!

-   There is more than one tool:

    -   ChatGPT

    -   Claude

    -   Perplexity

    -   Gemini
