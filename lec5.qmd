## Standard Normal Distribution

### What do we know about normal distributions?

## Standard Normal Distribution

### Properties and Principles

The 4 properties of a standard normal distribution are:

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   They are shaped like a bell ("bell curve").

-   They are symmetric.

-   They are unimodal.

-   The mean = median = mode.
:::

## Standard Deviation

### Standard deviation is in the scale of the variable (`x`).

-   A standard deviation of 1 means a distance of 1 on the scale used to measure the variable.

## Standard Normal Distribution

### Example 1

> Jonas scores a 98 on the exam. The average grade on the exam was 97 with a standard deviation of 1.

-   Find Jonas' score on the normal distribution.

:::

## Standard Normal Distribution

### Where do most scores fall in relation to the mean?

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Most scores fall within one standard deviation of the mean.

-   "Within one standard deviation" means +1 as well as -1 standard deviation.
:::

## Standard Normal Distribution

### Percentages and Proportions

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   68.3% of the data will fall within 1 SD of the mean.

-   95.4% of the data will fall within 2 SD of the mean.

-   99.7% of the data will fall within 3 SD of the mean.

## Standard Normal Distribution

### Example 1

> Students' ratings of the Netflix Original *Dark* (range = 1- 10) form a normal distribution with m = 6 and s = 1.

-   What percentage of Students rate it a 7 or higher?

-   What percentage of Students rate it at least a 4?

-   What percentage of Students rate it an 8 or lower?

## Z-scores

### What does it do?

A z-score tells you, in standard deviation units how far the x-value is from the mean.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Z-scores are better than using raw SD,

-   When the SD is a decimal, it is hard to find the exact point under the standard normal curve.
:::

### Rule of Thumb

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/bell_prop2.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   The distance from the mean to the 1 on this standard normal curve is equal to the SD.

## Z-scores\]

### What do they do!

Z-scores re-express the original data points (the `x`'s) in a way that intuitively lets us know:

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   How close the `x` is to the mean (AKA how much this particular participant is like the average person in the sample)

-   Where it falls in the dispersion of the distribution (AKA how different this particular participant is from the majority of people in the sample)
:::

## Calculating

### Z-scores

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Subtract the mean from each X value.

-   Divide by the standard deviation.
:::

:::: fragment
::: callout-tip
$$
z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}
$$
:::
::::

## Z-scores

### Z-Scores are calculated by

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Centering the X values on the mean: When we center the mean (AKA mean-centering), we set the mean to 0.

-   Dividing by the standard deviation

-   When we divide by the SD, the space from the mean is expressed in standard deviations.

## Z-scores

### A Familiar Face: $\bar{x} = 20$

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(gt)

tibble(
  x = c(10,10,20,30,30),
  `x-xbar` = x-mean(x),
  `(x-xbar)^2` = (x-mean(x))^2
) |>
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    x = md("$x$"),
    `x-xbar` = md("$x-\\bar{x}$"),
    `(x-xbar)^2` = md("$(x-\\bar{x})^2$")
  ) |> 
  opt_row_striping() |> 
  tab_options(
    table.font.size = px(25), # Adjust font size
    table.width = pct(80)   # Set table width as percentage
  ) |> 
    tab_style(
    style = 
      cell_text(
        weight = "bold"),
        locations = 
      cells_column_labels()
    ) |> 
  fmt_auto()

```

## Z-scores

### Formula in Action

::::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
::: callout-tip
## Average

$$\color{red}{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sum{x}}{n}$$
:::

:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: callout-tip
## Standard Deviation

$$s^2 = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\color{red}{\bar{x}})^2}{n-1}} = \frac{400}{4} = \sqrt{100} = s$$
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: callout-tip
## Z-Score

$$z =\frac{x-\color{red}{\bar{x}}}{s} =  \frac{20-10}{s}=\frac{-10}{s}$$

## Z-scores

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   We made the mean = 0: When you mean-center a distribution, you shift it along the number line.

-   We made the SD = 1: When you divide a distribution by the SD, you shrink the distribution down.

-   **BUT: The shape of the distribution remains the same.**

## Z-Scores

### Why Do We Care?

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   A z-score tells me where my score falls in SD units.

-   I can then look at this standard normal curve, and estimate what percentage of people did better or worse than me.
