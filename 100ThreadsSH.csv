[...] on you will go
though the weather be foul
On you will go
though your enemies prowl
On you will go
though the Hakken-Kraks howl
Onward up many
a frightening creek,
though your arms may get sore
and your sneakers may leak.


On and on you will hike
and I know youll hike far
and face up to your problems
whatever they are.


Youll get mixed up, of course,
as you already know.
Youll get mixed up
with many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with care and great tact
and remember that Lifes
a Great Balancing Act.
Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.


And will you succeed?
Yes! You will, indeed!

Personally, at first, I simply forced myself not to think about cutting and hid the knives. Not everything will work out right away. At first, you'll cut yourself less and less, and maybe then you'll become clean again. Hugs to you, you're doing great. I believe in you!yÃ¡y	","2"

Not only will it drastically reduce healing time, it will also scar way less obviously and aftercare isn't as tedious. If that's not an option, steri strips or butterfly strips can work. CONTRARY TO WHAT EVERYONE SAYS, DONT DIY THEM! THE GLUE FROM THE TAPE YOU USE MIGHT GET IN THE WOUND (happened to me). If those are also not an option then here's the copy pasted bit: You're gonna want to clean it with JUST WATER (preferably distilled- saline solution works great too) every single day, then pat it dry with a cloth that doesn't release its fibers. I personally have a specific towel I use for my sh. Do this between bandage changes. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR BANDAGES EVERYDAY. you CAN change it every two days, but it's gonna look pretty disgusting. A tip: put a very thin layer of vaseline on the bandage or whatever dressing you have where the cut is going to be. This will help greatly in not making it stick so that a scab can form and you won't have to peel it off with your bandage (hurts like a bitch, trust me). Sometimes a cut may heal without a scab: this is not a cause for concern and can happen with cuts of this depth:)) The cut may release colourless, yellow or brown clear fluid. THIS IS NORMAL! it is the cut healing and cleaning itself. It will look disgusting and feel tender and may even swell a little- it might look a bit like infection, but you'll be able to tell if it's infected by whether the liquid is opaque (pus) or not and if it turns red around the wound. Just clean the liquid everyday and you'll be ok:)) I think that's all"" 

I really dont know how to cure that. Stay calm and try to keep everything clean","1"

&gt; Do you see anything white / yellowish oozing out? Looking almost like pus? You've cut into the hypodermis. It contains your adipose tissue, your body's fat storage. This can infect really badly if you just look at it too sternly. If I'm being honest, you could be lucky and won't have to go to the hospital. But you're taking a coinflip. Tails and you'll probably go into a short shock and get extremely dizzy, but overall will be fine. Heads and you end up with an infection. Then it's another coin flip to find out whether this infection spreads into the blood or stays in your skin. Both can make you lose body parts or die. Call an ambulance instead of flipping a coin.


This is exactly what happened when it seems bubbly.
The small hole you described could be a nick in a vein, probably why it's bleeding so much.

I hope by now you've applied a sterile compress on the wound and wrapped it in gauze. If not:

## Assuming you have a first aid kit around:

1. Apply a [sterile compress](https://www.bbraun-vetcare.com/en/products/b23/askina-gauze-compresses.html) on the wound with lots of pressure. Apply the pressure straight from above and push the opening together so it closes a bit. Make sure it's one that's packed not fully in plastic but in some paper-plastic mix material, only these are sterile.

2. Wrap 3 layers of gauze (can be a non sterile one from fully plastic packaging) around the pad, NOT TOO TIGHT, then put some compression material on the gauze above of the wound (could be another closed packet of gauze from the kit, or even something like a pencil eraser), then wrap the rest of the gauze around it as tight as possible.

## If you don't:

1. If you own a 100% cotton shirt, use that as a bandage. You have to tie it very tightly, that will hurt way more than with a bandage but will help the wound close. The blood stains can be washed out, that's not your main concern right now.

2. Alternatively, you can use a bathroom towel. Do NOT use paper towels, toilet paper, anything that dissolves basically, or things like wet wipes, anything with oils.

## After securing the wound:

1. Do you feel tingling in the extremities? If yes, you will need to call an ambulance.

2. Are you getting dizzy? Call an ambulance and tell them your address and that you are dizzy after bleeding a lot, and that they should please stay on call until you're better and if you don't get better they should send an ambulance. That way they won't call one when not necessary, but it'll be safer for you.

3. Observe the wound for the next few days. Any irritation further than ~1cm from the wound hints to an infection, which you should get checked out. Otherwise you should be fine for now.



Best thing is 100% to call an ambulance, but these are your other options for now.

Inside of open wounds I'd never apply antibiotics unless administered by a doctor, especially since I believe mupirocin is against staphylococci, and thus is very aggressive. So it shouldn't harm you, but usually you shouldn't do that.

If it's properly secured it's good, but it needs to be tight enough to avoid bruising. If it starts getting sore, pull it tighter.
And observe whether any rashes develop, if no you should be fine.","1_1_1"

Sister was super helpful about it, but I agree with the other commenters, DONT TELL YOUR PARENTS.

If you want to be indirect, just, pretend nothings wrong. Love her, support her. Give her a hug if yall did something fun together and yall both had a great time. Tell her that she did great when she did good at something. For me, just, ignoring the things that were making me want to hurt myself, cracking jokes with my sis, etc. 

I personally think its super important to have conversations about these types of things. If they are recent as they sound they are, this situation always has potential to get worse, as my sister was, and as Im sure you are, youre probably dying to know where that headspace is. Its super stressful, I know, but its important to also accept the pace she demands of you. Feelings are a lot. I dont need to elaborate on that, you know it, everyone here knows it.

If you bring it up, be honest about how you feel, that you love her, youre not mad, that youre only concerned, you want to be there for her, and most especially, that you wont tell your parents. I dunno yalls relationship and the depth of it, but maybe bring up yalls differences and just be open about that, but state at the bottom line, yall are siblings and you love her, and that you CARE. 

That was a lot, I hope any of it made a lick of sense or was helpful. At the end of the day, Im just some guy whos been thru some stuff and really wants to make something meaningful of that for others. Take it as you will.

I hope everything works out. Really hurts to see so many people sad nowadays, even for their own reasons.","2"

This post kinda paints that clear. It's like you take the meth away from the addict instead if easing them off. After all just throwing the knife out is simplest solution. And for some it works ,while others just have potential stronger relapses (personal experiance) some take a awhile. But, easing off sh is harder cause it's more mental. But that works for people, they progress, from daily to weekly to monthly to every few month. And others are still stuck doing it.","5"

One thing I believe can help is finding an alternative(s). Most people when trying to get clean make the mistake of not trying to find an alternative coping mechanism and then get frustrated when they still depend on sh, so finding different activities or solutions can help a lot.

Trying not to think in clean streaks can also help because that mindset can really bring you down sometimes. Like u/Nice-Marketing-3501 said, recovery and progress isnt linear. Its a struggle but one that gets easier over time.","5"

I personally never really starved, but I have gone for a few days without eating when things got really bad.

I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that eating _anything_ is almost always going to be better than eating nothing. So if there is any food that you feel like you _could_ eat, even just a bite, go for that, even if that would just be a piece of candy or whatever. My personal experience was that it gets easier after eating that first little bit, but even if it doesn't, just eating that little bit would already be really great!

You could also consider looking into other, healthier coping mechanisms that could maybe work for you. Letting go of starving should be much easier when you have some other mechanism to fill its role. Part of that process could be to get some therapy or counselling, but that's ultimately up to you.","10"

Honestly If you think about It self harm needs a lot of energies, at least for me, both physically and mentally.
You have to ""organizer"", to ""plan"" the thing, you feel stressend, and sad, and angry, and then you have to clean up or take care of your wounds.
Sometimes I just can't, I'm too lazy for all that, so I just don't. But then I feel guilty, sometimes I do It later, sometimes I just leave It.
I don't like not doing It, but sometimes I can't help it.
But It only happens when the urge isn't that strong or if I'm very tired.","1"

She had been standing behind me, and noticed my scars. She apologized for aproaching me, and then rolled up her sleeve to show me her own scars. We hugged each other and exchanged a few words before she left.  
During the same festival, I met a father and his son who had traveled very far to attend the festival. We hit it off while waiting for a band to come on stage, and I reccomended some things they should try while they were in the country. I was there alone after having been stood up. But he made me feel so much better. He was one of the kindest people I've met, and made me feel less alone. During the concert, I took off the sweater I was wearing over my t shirt. He noticed my scars and gave me a sort of sad smile. After the set, as we were saying goodbye, he said he hoped things got better and gave me a hug.  
Those two interactions meant a lot to me. Sometimes small comments and gestures like that can be very nice, especially when they come from other people who know what it's like.  
HOWEVER, you never know how someone is going to react. And sometimes, it's not appropriate or kind to point out peoples scars at all. If I was a customer, and the cashier/waiter/etc said anything about my scars, even if I could see they had scars too, I would feel very uncomfortable. It really depends on the person, and the setting.  
In your case, I would say it's better to leave it alone. If you want to make the customer feel less alone, I think a better approach is to just be kind and use your words/body language to make them feel seen. Rather than bringing up something that is likely very painful.","4"

I am legit horrified at this question. 
If someone asked me if my scars were from self harm, that would set me back quite a bit. 
It would be incredibly selfish to upset someone just so you can get some validation.
Also I really am concerned about the nature of this post. Self harm isnt cool, and neither are the scars. I felt the urge to say that because the overall tone of your post gave me the creepy crawlies. 
Im devastated and humiliated I ever self harmed. I dont want to know anyone can tell. 

And how do you even know thats what her scars are from???

ETA - actually, just dont make comments to any stranger about their body, no matter if you like what you see, or dont. Peoples bodies are their own, and not for strangers to turn into a freak show.","8"

the last time he called my parents was when i told him i was planning to kill myself and i shouldnt be left alone. i said it was probably best for me to go back to the psychward for a period of time because i was really going to hurt myself. the psychologist wrote a letter saying i should be admitted before things escalated, we showed the letter to the ED and sat in the waiting room for 6 hours. i was so tired that we gave up and went home. the hospital said they would call us in the morning but they never did. i was able to get better but imagine if i wasnt, and i did something really bad and the hospital and my support systems turned me away","8"

im typically a fairly clumsy person, so when im going about my day ill make note of things that i could accidentally injure myself on or doing, so i have excuses if someone ask. for your specific situation id probably say something like oh yeah, my cat climbed on my neck while i was sitting on my couch and when i tried to get em off i got my shoulder scratched up pretty badly. my main advice is to try and make it seem realistic, dont outwardly appear anxious, and give details! people are more likely to believe you if you answer them really casually and provide some details here and there, they dont have to know its complete bullshit lmao. and even if they dont believe you, the more casual about it you are the less likely they are to pry. its also good to have some excuses on the back burner memorized so you wont have to come up with stuff on the fly","4"

Someone wrote ""i deserve to bleed"" also i think ""prom dress"" talks about ED and self harming by starving



But one of my favourites which is AMAZING is ""sharpener"" by cavetown =%=%
talks about how it's viewed by society and kinda has a cool animation for it on YouTube



Some songs has parts where it feels like it's talking about self harm but maybe that's just how I imagined it to be or js how i relate to it
Something like ""line without a hook"" where Ricky says smth like ""if i go and hurt my body would you love me the same"" even though I'm not sure if it's self harm still cool



Also some rebzyyx mentiones self harm stuff like ""painforever"" or  the famous one ""all i want is you"" he?(hope I got the right pronoun) says smth like ""got tons of bloody tissues"" which i guess it's about cutting
And for me there's this song called ""it's all about you"" it only has a part where it mentions arms full of cuts but it's cool tbh i don't really listen to rebzyyx much tho



And I need more songs about sh or that mention sh so if you got some tell mee plz!
And hope u like them hehe i don't really have much sadly","3"
