## Method Section

### Objective

There are three objectives accomplished in the Method Section:

-   **Transparency**

    -   Allows **replication** of the study.

-   **Organization**

    -   Structured approach to presenting details.

-   **Credibility**

    -   Demonstrates rigor and **validity**.

## Components of the Method Section

### Participants

-   Number of participants.
-   Demographics (age, gender, other **relevant** factors).
-   **Recruitment** method.

## Components of the Method Section

### Materials

-   Instruments (e.g., scales, questionnaires).
-   Description and citation of tools used.

## Components of the Method Section

### Procedure

-   Step-by-step explanation of what participants did.
-   Timeline of events.
-   **Ethical considerations** (e.g., informed consent, debriefing).

## Components of the Method Section

### Design

-   Specify research design (e.g., **experimental**, **correlational**).
-   Variables (Independent Variables, Dependent Variables, and control).

# Example Review

## Writing Exercise

> You are conducting a study to explore how exposure to morbidly curious stimuli (e.g., unpleasant smells, sights, or sounds) influences people’s emotional reactions and decision-making. The research focuses on visual stimuli (e.g., unsettling images) and their impact on self-reported curiosity and arousal levels.

. . .

-   The study uses two groups:
    -   Participants who view neutral images (e.g., landscapes).
    -   Participants who view morbidly curious images (e.g., depictions of natural disasters or abandoned locations).

## Writing Exercise

> After viewing the images, participants rate their curiosity and emotional arousal using a validated 5-point Likert scale.

-   **Participants**
    -   Who would participate and how they are selected.
-   **Materials**
    -   Instruments or tools used for the study.
-   **Procedure**
    -   Describe how the study will be conducted.
-   **Design**
    -   Outline the study design and variables.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

-   Overgeneralization or lack of specificity.
-   Omitting key details (e.g., sample size or instrument reliability).
-   Failing to justify design choices.
    -   Why *this* sample?
    -   Why *these* stimuli?
    -   Why *this* design over another?
-   Forgetting to mention IRB approval or informed consent.
-   Using vague descriptions of measures (“a survey”) instead of naming/citing validated instruments.

## Method Section Example

### The Good, Bad, and the Ugly

> **Participants**
>
> Some people were in the study. They were college students, I think. Not sure how many, but it was enough.
>
> **Materials**
>
> We used some pictures and stuff that were kind of gross and some others that weren’t. Also, we had a survey thing but it was just a basic questionnaire.
>
> **Procedure**
>
> First, participants came to the lab. Then they looked at the pictures. After that, they filled out the survey. It didn’t take too long. They got credit or something.
>
> **Design**
>
> It was kind of like an experiment but also not really. We compared the groups who saw the different pictures.

## Writing Exercise

### Sample Section

> Participants
>
> One hundred twenty undergraduate students (M~age~ = 20.4, 65% female) were recruited through the university participant pool.
>
> Materials
>
> Stimuli included 20 images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 2008). Participants rated each image on a 5-point curiosity scale.
>
> Procedure:

> Design
