## Method Section
### Objective

-   *Transparency*: Allows replication of the study.

-   *Organization*: Structured approach to presenting details.

-   *Credibility*: Demonstrates rigor and validity.

## Components of the Method Section 

-   Participants
-   Materials
-   Procedure
-   Design

## Components of the Method Section 
## Participants

-   Number of participants.
-   Demographics (age, gender, other relevant factors).
-   Recruitment method.

## Components of the Method Section     
### Materials:
    
-   Instruments (e.g., scales, questionnaires).
-   Description and citation of tools used.

## Components of the Method Section 
### Procedure:
    
-   Step-by-step explanation of what participants did.
-   Timeline of events.
-   Ethical considerations (e.g., informed consent, debriefing).

## Components of the Method Section 
### Design:
    
-   Specify research design (e.g., experimental, correlational).
-   Variables (IVs, DVs, and control).

## Example Review



## Writing Exercise 

> You are conducting a study to explore how exposure to morbidly curious stimuli (e.g., unpleasant smells, sights, or sounds) influences people’s emotional reactions and decision-making. The research focuses on visual stimuli (e.g., unsettling images) and their impact on self-reported curiosity and arousal levels.

-   The study uses two groups:
    
    - Participants who view neutral images (e.g., landscapes).
    - Participants who view morbidly curious images (e.g., depictions of natural disasters or abandoned locations).

## Writing Exercise 

After viewing the images, participants rate their curiosity and emotional arousal using a validated 5-point Likert scale.

-   *Participants*: Who would participate and how they are selected.
-   *Materials*: Instruments or tools used for the study.
-   *Procedure*: Describe how the study will be conducted.
-   *Design*: Outline the study design and variables.
-   *Peer Review*: Students exchange drafts and give constructive feedback.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

-   Overgeneralization or lack of specificity.
-   Omitting key details (e.g., sample size or instrument reliability).
-   Failing to justify design choices.
