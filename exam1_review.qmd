## **Mean Calculation**
### Sample Mean Calculation

>  A psychology researcher collects the following data on the number of hours five participants spent practicing a task: **3, 5, 8, 2, 7**.

**Question:** What is the mean number of hours spent practicing?

## **Mean Calculation**
### Sample Mean Calculation

> A study measures the changes in mood scores before and after an intervention. The changes in mood scores are: **-4, -2, 0, 3, 5**.

**Question:** Calculate the mean change in mood score.


## **Standard Deviation Calculation**
### Sample Standard Deviation

> A psychologist measures the number of stressful events experienced by a small group of participants over a week: **2, 3, 6, 4, 5**.\

**Question:** Calculate the standard deviation of stressful events.

## **Standard Deviation Calculation**
### Sample Standard Deviation

> **Sample Standard Deviation** 
Participants' anxiety scores in a clinical trial are recorded as: **4, 7, 3, 5, 8, 6, 2**.\

**Question:** Compute the standard deviation of these anxiety scores.

## **Standard Deviation Calculation**
### Interpreting Standard Deviation in Psychology

> A researcher finds that the standard deviation of reaction times in a cognitive task is **1.5 seconds**. Another researcher finds a standard deviation of **0.5 seconds** for a similar task.\

**Question:** Which task shows more variability in participants' reaction times, and what might this indicate about task difficulty?

## **Z-Score Calculation**
### Z-Score for a Single Value

> In a personality study, the average score on an extraversion scale is **50**, with a standard deviation of **10**. One participant scores **70**.

**Question:** What is the Z-score for this participant?

## **Z-Score Calculation:**
### Interpreting Z-Scores

> A participant in a self-esteem survey has a Z-score of **-1.5**. The mean self-esteem score for the survey is **40**, and the standard deviation is **5**.\

**Question:** Did this participant score above or below the mean, and by how many standard deviations?

## **Z-Score Calculation**
### Z-Score with Negative Value

> The mean stress score of a group is **25**, with a standard deviation of **4**. If a participant has a stress score of **18**,\

**Question:** Calculate their Z-score and interpret its meaning in the context of stress levels.

## **Z-Score Calculation**
### Multiple Z-Scores

> In a clinical assessment, the average depression score is **60**, with a standard deviation of **8**. Two participants have scores of **72** and **48**.\

**Question:** Calculate the Z-scores for both participants and explain what the values tell us about their relative positions in the group.
