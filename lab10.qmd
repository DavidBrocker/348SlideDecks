## 🧪 ANOVA Lab Activity
### "Which Study Method Works Best?"

---

## 📘 Concept: One-Way ANOVA

- Compares **means across 3+ groups**
- Used when you want to test if at least one group differs from the others
- Tests the null hypothesis that all group means are equal

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Scenario

> Three groups of students used different methods to study for a quiz:
> - **Video lectures**
> - **Reading the textbook**
> - **Flashcards**
>
> Each student then took the same 10-question quiz.

---

## 📊 Simulated Data in R

```r
set.seed(123)

study_data <- data.frame(
  method = rep(c("Video", "Textbook", "Flashcards"), each = 15),
  score = c(
    rnorm(15, mean = 7.5, sd = 1),    # Video
    rnorm(15, mean = 6.5, sd = 1.2),  # Textbook
    rnorm(15, mean = 8.0, sd = 0.8)   # Flashcards
  )
)
```

---

## 📊 Visualizing Scores

```r
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(study_data, aes(x = method, y = score, fill = method)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Quiz Scores by Study Method") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## 🔬 Running ANOVA

```r
anova_result <- aov(score ~ method, data = study_data)
summary(anova_result)
```

- Look at the **F value** and **p-value**
- If p < .05 → reject the null hypothesis

---

## 🔍 Post Hoc (Tukey HSD)

```r
TukeyHSD(anova_result)
```

- Shows **which pairs** of study methods differ significantly
- Adjusts for multiple comparisons

---

## 🧠 Discussion Prompts

1. Which group performed best?
2. Is the difference statistically significant?
3. Is the difference **practically** meaningful?
4. What might influence quiz performance beyond method?

---

## 📦 Wrap-up

- One-way ANOVA compares 3+ means
- Helps determine if study methods influence outcomes
- Real-world applications: education, psychology, marketing, more
