# Introduction to Comparing Means

## Why Compare Means?

-   We often want to test whether a sample mean differs from a known population mean.
-   The **one-sample t-test** helps determine if the sample mean is significantly different from the hypothesized population mean.
-   Example scenarios:
    -   Does the average exam score in a class differ from a national average of 75?
    -   Do people‚Äôs reaction times differ from a published standard of 250ms?

## Assumptions of the One-Sample t-Test

1.  The data are **continuous** (interval or ratio scale).
2.  The sample is **randomly selected**.
3.  The data are **normally distributed** (or the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply).

## The One-Sample t-Test Formula

The test statistic is calculated as:

$$ t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} $$

Where:

-   $\bar{X}$ = sample mean

-   $\mu$ = population mean (null hypothesis value)

-   $s$ = sample standard deviation

-   $n$ = sample size

# Example: Exam Scores

## Hypothesis Testing Steps

1.  **Set Hypotheses:**
    -   $H_0$: The average exam score is 75 ($\mu = 75$).
    -   $H_A$: The average exam score is **not** 75 ($\mu \neq 75$).
2.  **Collect Sample Data:**
    -   Sample size: $n = 20$
    -   Sample mean: $\bar{X} = 78$
    -   Sample standard deviation: $s = 5$

## Hypothesis Testing Steps

3.  **Compute the t-Statistic:**

$$ t = \frac{78 - 75}{5 / \sqrt{20}} = \frac{3}{1.118} = 2.68 $$

4.  **Compare to Critical Value:**
    -   Using a $\alpha = 0.05$ level and df = 19, critical $t_{.025,19} = \pm 2.093$.
    -   Since $2.68 > 2.093$, we reject $H_0$.

## Reporting Results

APA-style:

> A one-sample t-test was conducted to compare exam scores to the national average of 75. Results showed a significant difference, **t(19) = 2.68, p \< .05**, indicating that students scored significantly higher than the national average.

# Interpreting Results

-   A **significant** result ($p < .05$) suggests that the sample mean is different from the population mean.
-   A **non-significant** result ($p > .05$) means we fail to reject $H_0$ (no evidence of a difference).

## Sample Summary Table

| Measure         | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| Sample Mean     | 78    |
| Population Mean | 75    |
| Sample SD       | 5     |
| Sample Size     | 20    |
| t-Statistic     | 2.68  |
| p-Value         | 0.014 |

## Boxplot Example

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data <- data.frame(Scores = c(72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 81, 77, 79, 78, 76,
                             80, 82, 74, 75, 78, 77, 76, 79, 80, 78))
ggplot(data, aes(y = Scores)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 78, lty = "dashed", color = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Exam Scores Distribution") + 
  annotate("text", x = 1.2, y = median(data$Scores), 
           label = "Median", hjust = 0, color = "blue") +

  # Annotate IQR (Box)
  annotate("text", x = 1.2, y = quantile(data$Scores, 3/4), 
           label = "Q3 (75th percentile)", hjust = 0, color = "red") +
  annotate("text", x = 1.2, y = quantile(data$Scores, 1/4), 
           label = "Q1 (25th percentile)", hjust = 0, color = "red") +
  
  # Annotate Whiskers
  annotate("text", x = 0.8, y = max(data$Scores), 
           label = "Max (Upper Whisker)", hjust = 1, color = "black") +
  annotate("text", x = 0.8, y = min(data$Scores), 
           label = "Min (Lower Whisker)", hjust = 1, color = "black")

## üìù **Example 1: Exam Scores vs. National Average**

### **Scenario**

A professor wants to test if students in their class scored **differently** from the national average of 75 on an exam. A sample of **25 students** has a mean score of **78** with a standard deviation of **10**.

### **Hypotheses**

-   **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: ( \mu = 75 ) (no difference)\
-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: ( \mu \neq 75 ) (scores differ)

### **Calculation**

Using the one-sample t-test formula:

\[ t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} \]

Substituting values:

\[ t = \frac{78 - 75}{10 / \sqrt{25}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \]

For **df = 24**, the critical value at **Œ± = .05** (two-tailed) is **¬±2.064**. Since **1.5 \< 2.064**, we **fail to reject (H_0)**.

### **APA Reporting**

*A one-sample t-test was conducted to determine whether students‚Äô exam scores differed from the national average (M = 75). Results were not statistically significant, ( t(24) = 1.5, p \> .05 ), indicating that students performed similarly to the national average.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìù **Example 2: Daily Coffee Consumption**

### **Scenario**

A coffee company claims that people drink an average of **3 cups** of coffee per day. A researcher samples **16 individuals**, finding a **mean of 2.5 cups** and a **standard deviation of 1 cup**.

### **Hypotheses**

-   **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: ( \mu = 3 )\
-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: ( \mu \< 3 ) (people drink less)

### **Calculation**

\[ t = \frac{2.5 - 3}{1 / \sqrt{16}} = \frac{-0.5}{0.25} = -2.0 \]

For **df = 15**, the critical t-value for a **one-tailed test** at **Œ± = .05** is **-1.753**. Since **-2.0 \< -1.753**, we **reject (H_0)**.

### **APA Reporting**

*A one-sample t-test was conducted to test whether daily coffee consumption was lower than the reported average of 3 cups. Results showed a significant difference, ( t(15) = -2.0, p \< .05 ), suggesting that people consume significantly fewer cups of coffee per day than reported.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìù **Example 3: Sleep Duration Among College Students**

### **Scenario**

A health researcher believes college students sleep **less than 7 hours** per night. A sample of **30 students** reports a mean of **6.5 hours** with a standard deviation of **1.2 hours**.

### **Hypotheses**

-   **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: ( \mu = 7 )\
-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: ( \mu \< 7 )

### **Calculation**

\[ t = \frac{6.5 - 7}{1.2 / \sqrt{30}} = \frac{-0.5}{0.219} = -2.28 \]

For **df = 29**, the critical t-value for a **one-tailed test** at **Œ± = .05** is **-1.699**. Since **-2.28 \< -1.699**, we **reject (H_0)**.

### **APA Reporting**

*A one-sample t-test was conducted to test whether college students sleep fewer than 7 hours per night. Results were statistically significant, ( t(29) = -2.28, p \< .05 ), indicating that students get significantly less sleep than the recommended amount.*

## Conclusion

### One Sample T-Test

-   The one-sample t-test is useful for comparing a sample mean to a known population mean.
-   Always check assumptions before conducting the test.
-   Report results in APA format, including effect size if necessary.
