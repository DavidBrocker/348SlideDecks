## Using Posit Cloud for Statistics Students

Posit Cloud is a web-based platform that allows you to run R and RStudio directly in your browser—no need to install anything on your computer! It’s perfect for statistics courses where you’ll work with data, run analyses, and create visualizations.

### Why Use Posit Cloud?

• **No Installation Needed**: Just log in and start coding.

• **Access Anywhere**: Works on any device with internet access.

• **Collaborative**: Share projects with classmates or receive assignments from your instructor.

• **Consistent Environment**: Everyone uses the same setup, reducing tech issues.

### How to Get Started

1.  [**Sign Up**](https://posit.cloud/plans/instructor?option=instructor-student-pay): Go to posit.cloud and create a free account (use your school email if required).

2.  **Join Your Class Workspace**: Your instructor may provide a link or invite code to access course projects.

3.  **Create/Access Projects**: A project is like an RStudio session where you can write code, import data, and save your work.

### Key Features

• **Script Editor**: Write and save R scripts (.R files).

• **Console**: Run quick R commands interactively.

• **Environment Tab**: See your data, variables, and objects.

• **Files Pane**: Upload datasets (e.g., .csv files) for analysis.

### Tips for Success

• **Save Often**: Posit Cloud autosaves, but hitting Ctrl + S helps prevent hiccups.

• **Organize Projects**: Keep different assignments in separate projects for easy access.

• **Install Packages Carefully**: If a package isn’t installed, use install.packages("package_name")—but check if your instructor has pre-installed them in shared projects.
