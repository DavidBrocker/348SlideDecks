## Statistical Software

### Excel, R, SPSS, Jamovi, JASP – Oh My!

There are several tools you can use for statistical analyses.

::: highlight-last
-   PSY 360 (Research Methods) typically employs the use of both Excel and SPSS

-   I think the best approach is to use these options *in addition* to free software such as R.

### Excel, R, SPSS, Jamovi, JASP – Oh My!

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   R is available on all Operating Systems completely free of charge and can even be accessed through web browsers such as Safari, Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox.

    -   As an added bonus, R is *even* accessible in *this* presentation! Press \~ to see

### Why should I care?

Your time is worth something and if I can show you a different way of approaching statistical questions that you might find easier—I will do whatever I can to do so!

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Your future job might not have SPSS

-   You can learn programming syntax and troubleshoot in real-time
:::

## Statistical Software

### Excel

We have used Microsoft Excel in this course to demonstrate core concepts such as finding the arithmetic average, standard deviation, measures of central tendency, and calculating z-scores.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Since statistical tests are mathematical at a base-level, (most) any test can be run in Excel that can be run elsewhere

### Excel

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Excel has dedicated first-party addons such as `Data Analysis Toolpak` and third-party addons as well. The `Data Analysis Toolpak` can be used to run the following tests:

### Excel

Whoa! Those are *a lot* of tests! Excel is an absolute powerhouse, but some of the tests and options are somewhat difficult to access and/or have a steep learning curve.

## Statistical Software

### SPSS

> SPSS (Statistical Principles for Social Science) is used in a variety of disciplines and has options for the majority of tests that you will end up running in your academic career. SPSS also has a syntax editor which allows you to have more control over your data/tests/outputs.

## Statistical Software

### SPSS: Example

Let's walk through an example in SPSS step-by-step.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Open up the dataset `move_dat_reduced.csv` from Brightspace

-   Double-click on IBM SPSS and wait for the file to open
:::

## SPSS: Example

### Descriptive Statistics

SPSS does its best to analyze your data and assign data value types (continuous, nominal) as well as scales of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   SPSS will *only* allow specific data types to be analyzed in specific ways

-   SPSS does not always 'know' what you are looking for, so *you* need to make sure your data is set up correctly!
:::

## SPSS: Example

### Descriptive Statistics

SPSS has two views, `Variable View` and `Data View`

Variable View: Provides an overview of your variables.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   What is the name?

-   What is the data type?

-   What is the range of values?

-   Are there any labels?

-   What is the Measure type?
:::

## SPSS: Example

### Descriptive Statistics

SPSS has two views, Variable View and Data View

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Data View: Provides a glimpse of your raw data

    -   What is in the first column?

    -   What is in the second column?

    -   etc.
:::

## SPSS: Example

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive Statistics *describe* the data, they give us an idea of where our data (likely) comes from, the measures of central tendency, and estimation about normality can be made.

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Mean \| Sum

-   Standard Deviation

-   Range

-   Mode
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Kurtosis\*

-   Skewness\*
:::
:::::

## SPSS: Example

### Frequency Statistics

Frequency Statistics give us an idea of the composition of our dataset and allow us to make estimations and guesses in relation to the normality of our data

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Frequency of Responses (% or n)

-   Minimum Values

-   Max Values

-   Range
:::

## SPSS: Example

### Descriptive and Frequency Statistics

In our dataset, we want to investigate the *categorical composition* of our data as well as the *statistical makeup* of our data.

For the dataset provided, find the descriptive Statistics and Frequency Statistics for each variable of the appropriate data type.
