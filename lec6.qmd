### Proportional Breakdown

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   `68.3%` of the datapoints (the X's) will fall within `1 SD` of the mean.

-   `95.4%` of the datapoints (the X's) will fall within `2 SD` of the mean.

-   `99.7%` of the datapoints (the X's) will fall within `3 SD` of the mean.

### Why do we care?

Z-scores re-express the original data points (the X's) in a way that intuitively lets us know:
:::

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   How close the X is to the mean

-   Where it falls in the dispersion of the distribution

-   How much this participant is like the other person in the sample

## Z-scores

### Imagine that $s$ = 2 and $\bar{x}$ = 25

Z-scores are expressed in Standard Deviation units.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   $$z = 1 = 25 + 2 = 27$$

-   $$z = -2 = 25 - 2 = 23$$

-   $$z = 0.5 = 25 - .05 = 24.4$$
:::

## Calculating A Z-score

### Step-by-Step

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Mean-center the X values $x - \bar{x}$

    -   This makes the Mean = 0.

-   Dividing by the standard deviation $\frac{}{s}$

    -   Makes the SD = 1.
:::

## Calculating Probability

### Use the normal distribution

> The average grade on the exam was an 86 with a standard deviation of 4.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

set.seed(200)
tibble(
  student = 1:1000,
  x = rnorm(1000,86,4) |> round(2),
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x),
  sca = scale(x),
  dn = dnorm(x, mean(x), sd(x))
) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\n Exam Score: M = 86 | s = 4",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  scale_color_identity()
```

## Calculating Probability

> The average grade on the exam was an 86 with a standard deviation of 4. What is the probability of scoring a `94` or higher on the exam?

```{r}

set.seed(200)

tibble(
  student = 1:1000,
  x = rnorm(1000,86,4) |> round(2),
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x),
  sca = scale(x),
  dn = dnorm(x, mean(x), sd(x))
) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = ifelse(x > 94, "red","grey"))) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\n Exam Score: M = 86 | s = 4",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 94, color = "black") +

## Calculating Probability

### Use the normal distribution

> The average grade on the exam was an `86` with a standard deviation of `4`. What is the probability of scoring a `94` or higher on the exam?

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   $$z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s} = \frac{94-86}{4} = \frac{8}{4}=2$$

-   Z = `2` corresponds with `2.1%` and `0.1%` of the curve (`2.2%`) chance.
:::

## Example 2

### Test Time!

> The mean exam score was `86` with a standard deviation of `4`.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

set.seed(200)
tibble(
  student = 1:100,
  x = rnorm(100,86,4) |> round(2),
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x),
  sca = scale(x),
  dn = dnorm(x, mean(x), sd(x))
) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\nZ-Score: M = 86 | s = 4",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  scale_color_identity()
```

## Example 2

### Esmeralda's Second Test

What is the probability of scoring between an `82` and a `90`?

```{r}

set.seed(200)
tibble(
  student = 1:100,
  x = rnorm(100,86,4) |> round(2),
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x),
  sca = scale(x),
  dn = dnorm(x, mean(x), sd(x))
) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = ifelse(between(x,82,90), "black","grey"))) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\nZ-Score: M = 86 | s = 4",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 82, color = "maroon") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 90, color = "darkgreen")  +
  scale_color_identity()
```

## Example 2

### Esmeralda's Second Test

What is the probability of scoring between an `82` and a `90`?

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   $z = \frac{82-86}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1$

-   $z = \frac{90-86}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$

-   There is a 68.3% chance of scoring between `82` and `90`.
:::

## Example 3

### Esmeralda's Second Test

> Esmeralda's stats professor tells her class that the average score on the exam was a 72 with a standard deviation of 6, and the distribution of scores was normal.

```{r}
set.seed(200)
tibble(
  student = 1:1000,
  x = rnorm(1000,72,6) |> round(2),
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x),
  sca = scale(x),
  dn = dnorm(x, mean(x), sd(x))
) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\nZ-Score: M = 72 | s = 6",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  scale_color_identity() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()
  )
```

## Example 3

### Esmeralda's Second Test

Esmeralda wants to calculate the probability that she scored below `60`

```{r}
set.seed(200)
tibble(
  student = 1:1000,
  x = rnorm(1000,72,6) |> round(2),
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x),
  sca = scale(x),
  dn = dnorm(x, mean(x), sd(x))
) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = ifelse(x < 60, "black","grey"))) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\nZ-Score: M = 72 | s = 6",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 60, color = "maroon") +
  scale_color_identity() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()
  )
```

## Example 3

### Esmeralda's Second Test: $\bar{x} = 72 | s = 6$

Esmeralda wants to calculate the probability that she scored below `60`

::: fragment
-   $\frac{60-72}{6} = \frac{-12}{6} = -2$
:::

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   `2.2%` chance that she failed.

-   What's the chance she passed?

## Z-scores and Probability

### How does it apply?

In real life, we are often working with numbers with long decimal points rather than nice whole numbers.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Because the standard normal curve is STANDARD and NORMAL, we can calculate the exact probability of a z-score with a decimal point.

-   Calculate the z-score.
:::

## Z-scores and Probability

### How does it apply?

In real life, we are often working with numbers with long decimal points rather than nice whole numbers.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Locate the whole number and first decimal point along the left side of the table.

-   Locate the second decimal point along the top of the table.
:::

## Z-scores and Probability

The Z-score Probability Table gives you the probability of that z-score or **LESS**.

::: {.incremental .highlight-current-green}
-   If you need that z-score or higher, you have to subtract the decimal from 1.
:::

## Z-scores and Probability:

### Some examples

> In a recent study on world happiness, participants were asked to evaluate their current lives on a scale from `0` to `10`, where `0` represents the worst possible life and `10` represents the best possible life. The responses were normally distributed, with a mean of `5.4` and a standard deviation of `2.2`. Find the probability that a randomly selected study participant's response was:

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Less than 4

-   More than 8
:::

## Z-scores and Probability:

### Life Satisfaction: $\bar{x} = 5.4 | s = 2.2$

-   Find the probability that a randomly selected study participant's response was:

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Less than 4

-   More than 8

-   $$z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s} = \frac{4-5.4}{2.2} = \frac{-1.4}{2.2} = -.63$$

-   $$z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s} = \frac{8-5.4}{2.2} = \frac{2.6}{2.2} = 1.18$$
