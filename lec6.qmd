## Review

### Proportional Breakdown

-   `68.3%` of the datapoints (the X's) will fall within `1 SD` of the mean.

-   `95.4%` of the datapoints (the X's) will fall within `2 SD` of the mean.

-   `99.7%` of the datapoints (the X's) will fall within `3 SD` of the mean.

<!-- -->

-   Z-scores are expressed in Standard Deviation units.

## Z-scores

### Why do we care?

-   Z-scores re-express the original data points (the X's) in a way that intuitively lets us know:

    -   How close the X is to the mean

    -   Where it falls in the dispersion of the distribution

    -   How much this participant is like the other person in the sample

    -   Where it falls in the dispersion of the distribution

    -   How different this participant is from the majority of people in the sample

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(616)
z1 <- 
  tibble(
  student = 1:1000,
  x = rnorm(1000,75,2) |> round(2),
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x),
  sca = scale(x),
  norml = dnorm(x, mean(x), sd(x))
) |> 
  mutate(
  area = case_when(
    z >= 1 ~ "1SD",
    z <= -1 ~ "1SD",
    z >= 2 ~ "2SD",
    z >= -2 ~ "2SD",
    z >= 3 ~ "3SD",
    z <= -3 ~ "3SD"
    )
  )

  ggplot(aes(z,student, color = area)) +

       y = "Student\n") 

```

## Z-scores

### Why do we care?

```{r}
set.seed(616)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

z1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(z,student, color = area)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = ifelse(z <= -2,"red","grey"))) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = -2, color = "black", lty = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\nZ-Score",
       y = "Student\n") +
  scale_color_identity()

```

## Z-scores

### Imagine that $s$ = 2 and $\bar{x}$ = 25

-   $z = 1 = 25 + 2 = 27$

-   $z = -2 = 25 - 2 = 23$

-   $z = 0.5 = 25 - .05 = 24.4$

## Calculating A Z-score

### Step-by-Step

-   Mean-center the X values:

-   $x - \bar{x}$

    -   This makes the Mean = 0.

-   Divide by the standard deviation

-   $\frac{}{s}$

    -   Makes the SD = 1.

## Calculating Probability

### Use the normal distribution

> The average grade on the exam was an 86 with a standard deviation of 4.

```{r}
set.seed(200)

z2 <- tibble(
  student = 1:1000,
  x = rnorm(1000,86,4) |> round(2),
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x),
  sca = scale(x),
  dn = dnorm(x, mean(x), sd(x))
) 

z2 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_line(color = "darkgreen") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\n Exam Score: M = 86 | s = 4",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  scale_color_identity() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(70,102, by = 4))
```

## Calculating Probability

> The average grade on the exam was an 86 with a standard deviation of 4. What is the probability of scoring a `94` or higher on the exam?

```{r}

set.seed(200)

z2 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = ifelse(x > 94, "red","grey"))) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\n Exam Score: M = 86 | s = 4",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 94, color = "red") +
  scale_color_identity() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(70,102, by = 4))
```

## Calculating Probability

### Use the normal distribution

> The average grade on the exam was an `86` with a standard deviation of `4`. What is the probability of scoring a `94` or higher on the exam?

-   $z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s} = \frac{94-86}{4} = \frac{8}{4}=2$

-   Z = `2` corresponds with `2.1%` and `0.1%` of the curve (`2.2%`) chance.

## Example 2

### Test Time!

> The mean exam score was `86` with a standard deviation of `4`. What is the probability of scoring between an `82` and a `90`?

```{r}

set.seed(200)
z3 <- 
  tibble(
  student = 1:1000,
  x = rnorm(1000,86,4) |> round(2),
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x),
  sca = scale(x),
  dn = dnorm(x, mean(x), sd(x))
) 

z3 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_line(color = "black") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\nZ-Score: M = 86 | s = 4",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  scale_color_identity() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(70,102, by = 4))
```

## Example 2

### Test Time!

> The mean exam score was `86` with a standard deviation of `4`. What is the probability of scoring between an `82` and a `90`?

```{r}

z3 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = ifelse(between(x,82,90), "black","grey"))) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\nZ-Score: M = 86 | s = 4",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 82, color = "maroon") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 90, color = "darkgreen")  +
  scale_color_identity() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(70,102, by = 4))
```

## Example 2

### Esmeralda's Second Test

What is the probability of scoring between an `82` and a `90`?

-   $z = \frac{82-86}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1$

-   $z = \frac{90-86}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$

-   There is a 68.3% chance of scoring between `82` and `90`.

## Example 3

### Esmeralda's Second Test

> Esmeralda's stats professor tells her class that the average score on the exam was a 72 with a standard deviation of 6, and the distribution of scores was normal. Esmeralda wants to calculate the probability that she scored below `60`

```{r}
set.seed(200)

z4 <- 
  tibble(
  student = 1:1000,
  x = rnorm(1000,72,6) |> round(2),
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x),
  sca = scale(x),
  dn = dnorm(x, mean(x), sd(x))
) 

z4 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_line(color = "black") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\nZ-Score: M = 72 | s = 6",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  scale_color_identity() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(48, 96, by = 6))
```

## Example 3

### Esmeralda's Second Test

> Esmeralda's stats professor tells her class that the average score on the exam was a 72 with a standard deviation of 6, and the distribution of scores was normal. Esmeralda wants to calculate the probability that she scored below `60`

```{r}
z4 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x,dn)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = ifelse(x < 60, "black","grey"))) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\nZ-Score: M = 72 | s = 6",
       y = "Student\n") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), lty = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 60, color = "maroon") +
  scale_color_identity() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(48, 96, by = 6))
```

## Example 3

### Esmeralda's Second Test: $\bar{x} = 72 | s = 6$

Esmeralda wants to calculate the probability that she scored below `60`

-   $\frac{60-72}{6} = \frac{-12}{6} = -2$

-   `2.2%` chance that she failed.

-   What's the chance she passed?

-   $100-2.2 = 97.8%$

## Z-scores and Probability

### How does it apply?

In real life, we are often working with numbers with long decimal points rather than nice whole numbers.

-   Because the standard normal curve is standard and normal, we can calculate the **exact** probability of a z-score with a decimal point.

## Z-scores and Probability

### The Z-Table

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Locate the whole number and first decimal point along the left side of the table.

-   Locate the second decimal point along the top of the table.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Z-scores and Probability

### The Z-Table

The Z-score Probability Table gives you the probability of that z-score or **less**.

-   If you need that z-score or higher, you have to subtract the decimal from 1.
    -   Esmeralda had a `.022`% chance of failing and and a `1-.022%` chance of passing.

## Z-scores and Probability:

### Some examples

> In a recent study on world happiness, participants were asked to evaluate their current lives on a scale from `0` to `10`, where `0` represents the worst possible life and `10` represents the best possible life. The responses were normally distributed, with a mean of `5.4` and a standard deviation of `2.2`. Find the probability that a randomly selected study participant's response was:

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Less than 4

-   More than 8
:::

## Z-scores and Probability:

### Life Satisfaction: $\bar{x} = 5.4 \text{ and } s = 2.2$

-   Find the probability that a randomly selected study participant's response was:

-   Less than 4

    -   $z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s} = \frac{4-5.4}{2.2} = \frac{-1.4}{2.2} = -.63$

-   More than 8

    -   $z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s} = \frac{8-5.4}{2.2} = \frac{2.6}{2.2} = 1.18$

## Z-scores and Probability

### Example 1: $\bar{x} = 5.4 \text{ and } s = 2.2$

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<img src="images/z-table.png" alt="Z-table" style="display: block; width: 100%;"/>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Less than 4 (-.63)

- Find .6 on the left size of the table (z column)

- Find .03 column

- Note where they intersect

- Since we want the value less than 4, we need to subtract 1

- Report the value as a percentage ($z\times100$)

## Example 1

### Step by Step

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<img src="images/z-table.png" alt="Z-table" style="display: block; width: 100%;"/>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- More than 8 (1.18)

- Find 1.1 on the left size of the table (z column)

- Find .08 column

- Note where they intersect

- Report the value as a percentage ($z\times100$)

## Z-scores and Probability:

### Example 2

> The scale of scores for an IQ test are approximately normal with mean `100` and standard deviation `15`. The organization MENSA, which calls itself the "high IQ society", requires a score of `130` or higher.

- What percent of adults would qualify for membership?

    - Find the probability of scores more than 130
    
    - $z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s} = z = \frac{130-100}{15}=\frac{30}{15} = 2$

## Example 2

### MENSA: $\bar{x}=100 \text{ and } s = 15$

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<img src="images/z-table.png" alt="Z-table" style="display: block; width: 100%;"/>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- More than 130 (2)

- Find 2.0 on the left size of the table (z column)

- Find .00 column

- Note where they intersect

- Remember we are thinking about 130 or more so we have to subtract 1 from our proportion.

- Report the value as a percentage ($z\times100$)
