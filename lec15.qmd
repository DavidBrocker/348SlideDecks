## Introduction to Paired Samples t-Test

### What is a Paired Samples t-Test?

-   A statistical method used to compare the means of two related groups.
-   Commonly used when measuring the same group before and after an intervention or over two different conditions.

## Purpose of Paired Samples t-Test

### Why Use Paired Samples t-Test?

-   To determine if there is a statistically significant difference between two related group means.
-   Useful in psychology for assessing changes due to an intervention, therapy, or experiment.

## Formula for Paired Samples t-Test

### Mathematical Representation

-   **Formula**: $\large{t = \frac{\bar{D}}{\frac{s_D}{\sqrt{n}}}}$
    -   $\bar{D}$: Mean of the differences between paired observations.
    -   $s_D$: Standard deviation of the differences.
    -   $n$: Number of pairs.

## Theoretical Formula Explanation

### Understanding Each Component

-   **Difference Mean** $\bar{D}$: Average of the differences between paired scores.
-   **Standard Deviation of Differences** $s_D$: Indicates how much individual differences deviate from the mean difference.
-   **Sample Size** $n$: Number of pairs, affecting the significance of results.

## Application of Paired Samples t-Test

### When to Apply This Test

-   **Pretest-Posttest Design**: Measure changes in the same group over time.
-   **Matched Pairs**: Compare two related groups, such as twins or matched participants.
-   **Repeated Measures**: Test the same group under different conditions or at different times.

# Paired Samples t-Test Example

## Paired Samples t-Test

### Application in Psychology Research

> A psychologist measures stress levels of a group before and after a mindfulness program.

**Steps**:

-   Calculate the difference between pre- and post-intervention scores.
-   Find the mean $\bar{D}$ and standard deviation $s_D$ of the differences.
-   Apply the formula to calculate the t-value and check for significance.

## Paired Samples t-Test

### Application in Psychology Research

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(broom)
library(gt)

set.seed(20)
data <- 
  tibble(
  grp = rep(c("T1","T2"), each = 30),
  score = c(rnorm(30,8,2),rnorm(30,4,1)) |> round(0)
) 

t.test(score ~ grp, data = data) |> 
  tidy() |> 
  rename(
    D = estimate,
    t = statistic, 
    p = p.value,
    df = parameter) |> 
  mutate(
    `CI[uu,ll]` = paste0("[",conf.low |> round(2),", ",conf.high |> round(2),"]"),
    p = p |> round(10)
  ) |> 
  select(-conf.low:-alternative) |> 
  select(D,t,df,p,`CI[uu,ll]`) |> 
  gt()

```

## Summary of Paired Samples t-Test

### Key Takeaways

-   Paired samples t-tests are ideal for comparing two related groups.
-   They help determine if interventions or conditions produce significant changes.
-   Remember to check assumptions: normality of differences and appropriate pairing.
