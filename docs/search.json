Answered questions to the best of his ability. Made 9am class feel like a mid-day/evening class, not boring. Weirdly made me think statistics was fun and interesting. And that research is cool. Excited to take classes with him in the future.\n\n\nThis professor likes telling jokes and telling people to leave class which is cringey. he talks too fast and it’s very hard to keep up. very friendly, nice, caring, and accommodating but the jokes and talking speed is a bit much for me personally, not really my taste.\n\n\nProfessor brocker is in tune with the class and meets us at the level we are at and tries to pull us up to the level we are supposed to be. The only suggestion is that we need homework to reinforce what we have learned. Overall, prof. Brocker was inspiring, i never thought i would understand anything related to statistics, but he made it clear. He was always prepared, made time for us and helped us any way he could. He has such great energy, approachable, knows his material, finds ways to deliver the material. Really great experience, in spite of my grade. It was me, not him.\n\n\nThe professor is greatly appreciated. He made the course interesting and was very funny. I think his fun personality definitely helped keep us awake and interested in the course regardless of the time.\n\n\nVery knowledgeable and professional, very engaging with students and available for extra help\n\n\nHe is a great instructor but if you are not a stats lover you it can be very confusing, he is funny and has a personality.\n\n\nProf. Brocker is a wonderful professor and i am so happy i had this class with him. He could slow down in how he speaks as i don’t get every word he says cuz he speaks like the flash. His jokes are so funny and makes me now want to kill myself in math as much\n\n\nI love how fun you made the class, funny guy great teacher. material was great and you explained things very well.\n\n\nWith peace and love, he can slow down while he teaches\n\n\nGreat instructor hate statistics\n\n\nProfessor is very nice and calm man. He teaches the class very well and it shows how much he cares for his students. Is very lenient and easy going. Always can ask him any question when needed. I would take him again.\n\n\nPrior to taking this course, i strongly disliked math of any kind, but i have found a genuine love for statistics after this class. The class was taught well, and professor brocker was extremely helpful in teaching the material. Thanks for a great semester!\n\n\nBest professor i’ve ever had\n\n\nOverall you're a great person and your jokes were actually funny. You were available after class and was really generous with points for the exams.\n\n\nAwesome professor, did a great job teaching this class. Also loves riffing a lot.\n\n\nSuper approachable, understanding and just overall cares about his students. I would absolutely have him as a professor again.\n\n\nProfessor brocker is amazing. He truly takes his time to make sure the students understand the material, even if that means that he has to go over the same thing over and over again. Math is not my best subject, but he helped me understand statistics more than i ever knew before.\n\n\nI genuinely appreciated having professor brocker this semester. Even though the subject wasn't something i was particularly interested in, he made the class engaging and enjoyable. He has a great sense of humor and a very caring, approachable personality that made students feel comfortable participating and asking questions.\n\n\nWhat stood out most was how understanding and supportive he was, he always made time to help. His ability to connect with students and bring a positive energy to the classroom really made a difference. Overall, he's one of the most personable and helpful professors i've had, and i would definitely recommend his class to others.\n\n\nDr. Brocker was a very cool, down-to-earth professor.  He utilizes his knowledge for our gain.  I appreciated him as a professor.\n\n\nI was so nervous going into this class because math is very difficult for me. My anxiety was immediately relieved when i met professor brocker. He will do anything he can to make sure you actually understand the information. He cares about every student and will go to lengths to help every single student excel.\n\n\nDavid brocker has a genuine passion for teaching and a strong commitment to helping his students succeed. Despite me growing up disliking math, he has managed to make the subject interesting and approachable. He is truly the best professor i have ever had; i cannot say anything negative about him as both a professor and a person.\n\n\nFavorite professor i have had so far.\n\n\nProf. Brocker really cares about his students and it is obvious. He goes out of his way to get his students to understand the material. The material is hard and confusing at times but he tries to get you to understand using different approaches. \n\n\nGreat instructor\n\n\nHe took his time in teaching and made the lectures and labs very understandable. Before his exams, he always provided great reviews such as kahoot and review sheets.\n\n\nI'm not sure how i felt while learning but am thankful for what i've retained.\n\n\nProfessor brocker ensured that we demonstrated competence before progressing to the next topic. He welcomed all questions and provided thorough answers to ensure everyone understood before moving on. His slides were simplified to their most essential form, offering a clear understanding of each topic. He also included additional resources in his slides for students to reference after class. Overall, his teaching was very organized and beneficial for students.\n\n\nLearning was easy in this class. Professor made really took the the time to make sure we all understood the material.\n\n\nThis class is difficult. I spent most of the semester frustrated and confused. Then at the end of semester i was shocked that things were actually making sense. I am very pleased with the result. \n\n\nGreat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Responses to 'Comments about the Learniong Process\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\nI want to say that content was gone over fast but it definitely wasn't, math just makes me feel frantic. Dr. Brocker consistently took time out of each class to make sure he answered questions until students fully understood. Content was always listed on brightspace to review if need be. I definitely was always settled with each topic before taking tests.\n\n\nI did not learn anything in this class. i found the content hard and boring. \n\n\nFor students reentering academics, it’s a challenge.\n\n\nI think the course is well explained, since it’s a math course much of it is formulas and straight forward.\n\n\nAppreciated learning the concepts rather than the computational side\n\n\nThe learning process is pretty difficult if go to him for afterhours he explains clearer and you get a better understanding of what your doing.\n\n\nMath is terrible but not your fault \n\n\nTeaching was great, just wish we had a small assignment here and there to refresh my memory over the weekend and embed everything in my head \n\n\nWhen he goes back on the material, that’s when i retain the info better \n\n\nMade learning the difficult material easy and showed a lot of examples when talking about all of the topics. \n\n\nProfessor brocker helped make the material as simplistic and easy to understand as possible. \n\n\nEasy going learning process\n\n\nI usually have a really hard time learning math, but the way it was presented i really think i got a lot out of this course. I think i actually enjoyed it!\n\n\nThe class was structured amazing!\n\n\nNothing that i can think of.\n\n\nDue to professor brocker's consistent check-ins throughout the semester, i have no additional recommendations for improving his course. He adapted to our needs and encouraged constant feedback, ensuring that changes were made during the semester rather than after.\n\n\nN/a\n\n\nI really want more real world studies and examples. A group project that takes a real world data to analyze would be fun. \n\n\nThis course was great. I enjoy the learning and i understand a lot. just the way the modules were confusing on bright space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Responses to 'Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the course?\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\nNope, really appreciated all content that was used in class being uploaded for us to review. don't stop making dad jokes, really lightens the whole mood that math puts me in. \n\n\nI wish it was more interactive and interesting but it’s hard to make math interesting. \n\n\nA little more homework would have benefitted me, personally, but that is just my preference \n\n\nThis course is just fine the way it is its just math it isn't my strong suit.\n\n\nSlow down please \n\n\nWeekly or biweekly short assignments or even practice questions that are optional throughout the module, not only directly before the test \n\n\nJust slow your roll man &lt;3\n\n\nMore homework would help to get a better understanding of what student isn’t understanding. Also help to boost grades \n\n\nN/a\n\n\nI love the course and the way the material was given as is. \n\n\nI thought it was a well thought out course, no changes needed.\n\n\nBetter handwriting to see the board \n\n\nI wish there was more examples, maybe some homework practice questions to help understand the course material\n\n\nI think the only thing that could be improved was having examples. I learn a lot better with examples so putting examples on bright space for us to look at/complete on our own time if we wished would have been amazing."
