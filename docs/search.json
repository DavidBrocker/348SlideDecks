    "text": "Question 14\nAnswer\nConsider the output of a regression analysis where the R-squared value is 0.70 and the coefficient of the independent variable is 3.2 with a p-value of 0.02.\n\nInterpret the R-squared value in terms of the model’s explanatory power.\n\n\n\nAnswer: An R-squared value of 0.70 means that 70% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model.\n\n\n\nBased on the coefficient and p-value, would you consider this predictor variable significant? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nAnswer: Yes, the predictor is significant. The p-value of 0.02 is less than 0.05, indicating that the predictor variable is statistically significant at the 5% level."
