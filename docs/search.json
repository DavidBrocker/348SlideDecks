The \\(R^2\\) value for the model is 0.72.\n\n\nWhat does an \\(R^2\\) value of 0.72 tell you about how well hours spent studying explain the variance in exam scores? What percentage of the variance is explained by the model, and what percentage remains unexplained?\nImagine you are the researcher. Based on the \\(R^2\\) value of 0.72, would you consider study time to be a good predictor of exam performance? Why or why not?"
