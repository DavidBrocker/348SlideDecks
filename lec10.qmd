## From Paired to Independent Samples

Last time, we compared **two related means** — the *same participants* measured twice (e.g., before vs. after caffeine).

Now, we’ll compare **two unrelated means** — *different participants* in each group.

| Paired t-test                          | Independent t-test             |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Same people                            | Different people               |
| Within-subjects                        | Between-subjects               |
| Reduces error (individual differences) | Must estimate error separately |

## Sampling Theory (Recap)

-   Sampling theory allows us to test two unrelated group

-   We can compare the group means

# Generate data for two normal distributions
x <- seq(-6, 6, length=100)
null_dist <- dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)
alt_dist <- dnorm(x, mean = 2, sd = 1)

data <- data.frame(
  x = rep(x, 2),
  y = c(null_dist, alt_dist),
  hypothesis = factor(rep(c("Null Hypothesis", "Alternative Hypothesis"), each=length(x)))
)

# Create the plot

plt <- 
  ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y, 
                 lty = rev(hypothesis))) +
    geom_line(aes(color = "purple")) +

## Inferential Statistics

### **Applied to Independent Groups**

-   Our goal is still to test whether a difference is likely due to chance

-   With independnet samples, chance variation now includes **differences between individuals** in *both* groups.

## Group Variance

### Within and Between

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
To compare the means we need to know:

-   Between group variance: how much the answers from the **experimental** group differ from the **control** group.

-   Within group variance: how much the **answers of all participants** differ from one another.

df <- tibble(
  treatment = rep(c("Experimental", "Control"), each = 30),
  score = c(rnorm(30, 30, 2), rnorm(30, 40, 5))
)

## Independent Samples t-test Overview

Used when we compare **two different groups** on a continuous outcome.

-   **Examples:**

    -   Coffee drinkers vs. decaf drinkers on happiness

    -   Students with music vs. silence during study

    -   Phone use vs. no phone use before bed

-   **Goal:**

    -   Is the mean difference between groups larger than what we’d expect by chance?

## Independent Samples t-test

### Example

> The experimental group drinks caffeinated coffee. The control group drinks decaf. I ask both groups to complete a survey to measure their happiness on a scale of `1` to `10`.

-   The experimental group has a mean happiness score of `8`

-   The control group mean happiness score of `6`

::: fragment
Is the group that drank coffee significantly happier than the control group?

## Independent samples t-test

```{r}
#| echo: false

plt + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 2,
    color = "darkblue"
    ) + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 0, 
    color = "red"
    ) + 
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) + 
  geom_text(
    x = -4,
    y = .1,
    label = "M_Control = 6"
  ) +
    geom_text(
    x = -4.3,
    y = .05,
    label = "M_Exp = 8"
  )
```

## Independent samples t-test

To compare the means we need to know:

-   **Between group variance**: how much the answers from the experimental group differ from the control group.

-   **Within group variance**: how much the answers of all participants differ from one another.

## Formulas

Inferential statistics have both **theoretical** and **computational** formulas:

-   Theoretical

    -   Formula for if we actually knew the population parameters

-   Computational

    -   Formula for estimating the test statistics based solely on sample data

## Theoretical Formula:

$$\color{blue}{t} = \frac{\color{red}{\bar{x}} -\color{orange}{\mu}}{\sqrt{\color{grey}{s^{2}_{pooled}}}}$$

-   [t]{style="color:blue"} = T Statistic

-   [Sample Mean]{style="color:red"}

-   [Population Mean]{style="color:orange"}

-   [Pooled Variance]{style="color:grey"}

## Independent samples t-test

Theoretical Formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \color{green}{μ}}{\sqrt{s^{2}_{pooled}}}$$

## Independent samples t-test

### Theoretical Formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - μ}{\sqrt{\color{orange}{s^{2}_{pooled}}}}$$

## Independent samples t-test

### Theoretical Formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - μ}{\sqrt{s^{2}_{pooled}}}$$

## Independent samples t-test

### Theoretical Formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - μ}{\sqrt{s^{2}_{pooled}}}$$

## Independent samples t-test

### Computational Formula:

$$\frac{M_{Experimental}-M_{Control}}{\sqrt{\color{darkblue}{\frac{s1}{n1}+ \frac{s2}{n2}}}}$$

-   [Pooled Variance]{style="color: darkblue"}

## Independent samples t-test

### Computational Formula:

$$\frac{M_{Experimental}-M_{Control}}{\sqrt{\frac{s1}{n1}+ \frac{s2}{n2}}}$$

## Independent samples t-test:

### Assumptions of Independent Samples t-test

1.  **DV is continuous**\
2.  **Observations are independent**\
3.  **Normality:** each group’s distribution is approximately normal\
4.  **Homogeneity of variance:** variances are similar across groups

## Independent samples t-test:

### Assumptions of Independent Samples t-test

-   **Random sampling**:

    -   The data is randomly sampled from a population 

-   **Independence**:

    -   Each group must be made up of independent observations.

-   **Homogeneity of variance**:

    -   Variance should be equal across groups (tested with Levene's Test)

## Interpreting Levene’s Test

-   Levene’s Test tells us whether the assumption of equal variances holds.

    -   If p \> .05 → use the **top row**\*\* ("Equal variances assumed")

    -   If p \< .05 → use the **bottom row** ("Equal variances not assumed")

-   Normality

    -   Each group's distribution should be approximately normal

## Independent samples t-test

### Homogeneity of Variance

### ![](images/spiderman.png){style="border-radius: 20px;"}

::: fragment
If the **Levene's Test** is significant, use the t value from the second row and its corresponding significance.
:::

-   t is the test statistic.

-   Sig (2-tailed) is the p-value.

## Why Do We Care?

We need the **Levene's Test**, because if the variance from the experimental group is not equal to the variance of the control group, we have to use a different formula for the pooled standard deviation.

-   A significant Levene's Test means a significant difference in the variances.

## Independent samples t-test: SPSS

### Interpreting Results

If the **Levene's Test** is significant, use the t value from the second row and its corresponding significance

## Let’s Apply It: Three Independent Designs

We’ll test three common between-subjects designs:

1\. **Chocolate and Concentration** – Experimental vs. Control\
2. **Music and Studying** – Environmental manipulation\
3. **Phone Use and Sleep** – Behavioral difference

## Does chocolate improve concentration?

**Design Summary**

> 50 undergraduate students from XYZ University were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received a small piece of chocolate (70% dark cocoa) to consume before completing a 10-minute concentration task. The other group received no chocolate. The task measured sustained attention and was scored on a 0–20 scale.

-   **IV**: Chocolate (Yes vs. No)\
-   **DV**: Concentration task score\
-   **Design**: Between-subjects, randomized

## Summary: Independent Samples t-test

-   Compares **two independent groups**
-   Tests whether the difference in means is significant
-   Uses **pooled variance** as the denominator
-   Check assumptions: independence, normality, equal variance
-   Commonly used in **experimental** designs
