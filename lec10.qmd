## Sampling Theory

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr,warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(tidyr)

# Generate data for two normal distributions
x <- seq(-6, 6, length=100)
null_dist <- dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)
alt_dist <- dnorm(x, mean = 2, sd = 1)

data <- data.frame(
  x = rep(x, 2),
  y = c(null_dist, alt_dist),
  hypothesis = factor(rep(c("Null Hypothesis", "Alternative Hypothesis"), each=length(x)))
)

# Create the plot

plt <- 
  ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y, 
                 lty = rev(hypothesis))) +
    geom_line(aes(color = "purple")) +
  theme_linedraw() + 
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "",
    lty = "Hypotheses"
  ) + 
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "inside",
    legend.position.inside = c(.2,.5),
    legend.background = element_rect(color = "black")
  ) + 
  scale_color_identity()

plt 

```

## Sampling Theory

```{r}
#| echo: false

plt + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = -.8,color = "darkblue") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6))
```

## Sampling Theory

```{r}
#| echo: false

plt + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.6,color = "darkblue") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6))

```

## Sampling Theory

Setting alpha to 0.05, puts the critical value at a point where 5% of the null distribution's area is to the right of it.

```{r}
#| echo: false

plt + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 1.6,
    color = "darkblue"
    ) + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 1, 
    color = "red"
    ) + 
  geom_text(
    x = 1, 
    y = .05, 
    label = "Critical Value",
    color = "red",
    angle = 90,
    size = 3,
    vjust = -.4
    ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6)
    )

```

## Inferential Statistics

Each inferential statistic will give us:

-   Test statistic

    -   $r,t,F,\chi^2...$

-   p-value: probability of committing a Type 1 Error \< 0.05 or 5%

    -   p \> 0.05: Fail to reject the $H_0$

    -   p \< 0.05: Reject $H_0$

    color = "darkblue"
    ) + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 1, 
    color = "red"
    ) + 
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) + 
  geom_text(
    x = 1,
    y = .05,
    label = "Critical Value",
    angle = 90,
    color = "red",
    vjust = -1
  )
```

## T-tests

-   IV **must be** nominal and have *only* 2 categories

    -   Using experimental versus control

    -   Any two categories (bad/good)

-   DV **must be** continuous

    -   Scale of 1 to 10
    -   Count

## Independent Samples t-test

### Example

> The experimental group drinks caffeinated coffee. The control group drinks decaf. I ask both groups to complete a survey to measure their happiness on a scale of `1` to `10`.

-   The experimental group has a mean happiness score of `8`

-   The control group mean happiness score of `6`

::: fragment
Is the group that drank coffee significantly happier than the control group?

## Independent samples t-test

```{r}
#| echo: false

plt + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 2,
    color = "darkblue"
    ) + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 0, 
    color = "red"
    ) + 
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) + 
  geom_text(
    x = -4,
    y = .1,
    label = "M_Control = 6"
  ) +
    geom_text(
    x = -4.3,
    y = .05,
    label = "M_Exp = 8"
  )
```

## Independent samples t-test

To compare the means we need to know:

-   Between group variance: how much the answers from the **experimental** group differ from the **control** group.

-   Within group variance: how much the answers of all participants differ from one another.

## Independent samples t-test

To compare the means we need to know:

-   Between group variance

-   Within group variance

## Independent samples t-test

## Theoretical Formula:

$$\color{blue}{t} = \frac{\color{red}{\bar{x}} -\color{orange}{\mu}}{\sqrt{\color{grey}{s^{2}_{pooled}}}}$$

-   [t]{style="color:blue"} = T Statistic

-   [Sample Mean]{style="color:red"}

-   [Population Mean]{style="color:orange"}

-   [Pooled Variance]{style="color:grey"}

## Forumlas

Inferential statistics have both **theoretical** and **computational** formulas:

-   Theoretical

    -   Formula for if we actually knew the population parameters

-   Computational

    -   Formula for estimating the test statistics based solely on sample data

## Independent samples t-test

Theoretical Formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \color{green}{μ}}{\sqrt{s^{2}_{pooled}}}$$

## Independent samples t-test

### Theoretical Formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - μ}{\sqrt{\color{orange}{s^{2}_{pooled}}}}$$

## Independent samples t-test

### Theoretical Formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - μ}{\sqrt{s^{2}_{pooled}}}$$

## Independent samples t-test

### Theoretical Formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - μ}{\sqrt{s^{2}_{pooled}}}$$

## Independent samples t-test

### Computational Formula:

$$\frac{M_{Experimental}-M_{Control}}{\sqrt{\color{darkblue}{\frac{s1}{n1}+ \frac{s2}{n2}}}}$$

-   [Pooled Variance]{style="color: darkblue"}

## Independent samples t-test

### Computational Formula:

$$\frac{M_{Experimental}-M_{Control}}{\sqrt{\frac{s1}{n1}+ \frac{s2}{n2}}}$$

## Data Overview

```{r}
dat <- 
  tibble(
  grp = rep(c("Experimental","Control"),
            each = 10),
  happy = c(rnorm(10,8,1),rnorm(10,6,1)) |> round(0)

# INTERPRETTING T

## Independent samples t-test:

### Assumptions of the T-Test

-   **Data type**:

    -   The data is quantitative and continuous 

-   **Distribution**:

    -   The data is approximately normally distributed 

-   **Sample size**:

    -   The sample size is adequate

## Independent samples t-test:

### Assumptions of the T-Test

-   **Random sampling**:

    -   The data is randomly sampled from a population 

-   **Independence**:

    -   Each group must be made up of independent observations.

-   **Homogeneity of variance**:

    -   Variance should be equal across groups (tested with Levene's Test
        -   \## Interpreting Levene’s Test

            \- Levene’s Test tells us whether the assumption of equal variances holds.

            \- \*\*If p \> .05\*\* → use the \*\*top row\*\* ("Equal variances assumed")

            \- \*\*If p \< .05\*\* → use the \*\*bottom row\*\* ("Equal variances not assumed")

-   Normality

    -   Each group's distribution should be approximately normal

## Independent samples t-test

### Homogeneity of Variance

### ![](images/spiderman.png){style="border-radius: 20px;"}

::: fragment
If the **Levene's Test** is significant, use the t value from the second row and its corresponding significance.
:::

-   t is the test statistic.

-   Sig (2-tailed) is the p-value.

## Independent samples t-test

$$\frac{M_{Experimental}-M_{Control}}{\sqrt{\frac{s1}{n1}+ \frac{s2}{n2}}}$$

## Why Do We Care?

We need the **Levene's Test**, because if the variance from the experimental group is not equal to the variance of the control group, we have to use a different formula for the pooled standard deviation.

-   A significant Levene's Test means a significant difference in the variances.

## Independent samples t-test: SPSS

### Interpreting Results

If the **Levene's Test** is significant, use the t value from the second row and its corresponding significance

## Does chocolate improve concentration?

**Design Summary**

> 50 undergraduate students from XYZ University were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received a small piece of chocolate (70% dark cocoa) to consume before completing a 10-minute concentration task. The other group received no chocolate. The task measured sustained attention and was scored on a 0–20 scale.

-   **IV**: Chocolate (Yes vs. No)\
-   **DV**: Concentration task score\
-   **Design**: Between-subjects, randomized

### R Code

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gtsummary)
library(dplyr)
library(gt)
library(broom)

set.seed(42)
choco <- data.frame(
  concentration = c(rnorm(25, 15, 2), rnorm(25, 13.5, 2)),
  group = rep(c("chocolate", "no_chocolate"), each = 25)
)


# Plot

## 🎵 Example 2: Music and Study Efficiency

## Does instrumental music improve studying?

> **Design Summary**\
> 40 students participated in a study examining how background music affects studying. Participants were randomly assigned to study a short academic text under one of two conditions: instrumental music or silence. After 15 minutes of study time, they completed a 10-item multiple-choice quiz.

-   **IV**: Study condition (Instrumental music vs. Silence)\
-   **DV**: Quiz performance (number of correct answers)\
-   **Design**: Between-subjects, randomized

### R Code

```{r}

## 📱 Example 3: Phone Use and Sleep

## Does bedtime phone use affect sleep?

> **Design Summary**\
> 80 students from XYZ University took part in a study on sleep and cell phone use. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. One group was instructed to avoid phone use for 30 minutes before bed, while the other used their phones as normal. The next morning, all students rated their sleep quality on a 1–10 scale.

-   **IV**: Phone use before bed (Yes vs. No)\
-   **DV**: Sleep quality rating (1 = poor, 10 = excellent)\
-   **Design**: Between-subjects, randomized

### R Code

```{r}

set.seed(77)

sleep <- 
  data.frame(
    sleep_quality = 
      c(rnorm(40, 6.8, 1), rnorm(40, 7.4, 0.9)),
    group = rep(c("phone", "no_phone"), each = 40)
    )
