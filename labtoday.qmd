## Statistics Lab: One-Sample t-Test

### Objective

Students will:
	•	Conduct and interpret a one-sample t-test in R (or another platform you prefer).
	•	Compare their sample data to a known or hypothesized population mean.
	•	Communicate their findings in APA-style format.

## 1. Concept Refresher (5–10 minutes)

Prompt:
“Sometimes we want to know if a group we’re studying is different from the general population — but we only have one group’s data. The one-sample t-test helps us test whether our sample mean differs significantly from a known or hypothesized mean.”

Example questions to warm up:
	•	What does the t-test compare?
	•	What does the null hypothesis say in this context?
	•	How does sample size affect the t statistic?

## 2. Example Scenario Ideas (Pick one or rotate by section)

Each scenario includes a population mean and invites students to test a claim:

Theme	Scenario	Population Mean (μ₀)	Variable Example
🍫 Fun & Food	The average American eats 12 pounds of chocolate per year. Is our class different?	12	chocolate_pounds
📱 Technology	On average, college students spend 4 hours/day on their phone. Is our sample higher?	4	hours_per_day
💤 Sleep	The CDC recommends 8 hours of sleep per night. Does our sample get less?	8	sleep_hours
😬 Anxiety	National anxiety scale mean = 50 (SD = 10). Is our class more anxious?	50	anxiety_score

## 3. Data Collection (10–15 minutes)

Option 1: Live data collection
Have students submit quick responses via Google Form or Qualtrics (e.g., “How many hours of sleep did you get last night?”). Export as a .csv.

Option 2: Simulated dataset
Provide a dataset such as:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
sleep_data <- data.frame(
  sleep_hours = rnorm(30, mean = 7.2, sd = 0.9)
)
```

## 4. Analysis (15–20 minutes)

Step 1: State hypotheses
	•	H₀: μ = μ₀
	•	H₁: μ ≠ μ₀

Step 2: Run the test in R

```{r}
t.test(sleep_data$sleep_hours, mu = 8)
```

Step 3: Interpret the output
	•	t-value
	•	df
	•	p-value
	•	95% confidence interval
	•	Direction of difference

Step 4: APA write-up example

Students in our sample (M = 7.2, SD = 0.9) reported significantly less sleep than the CDC’s recommended 8 hours, t(29) = -4.67, p < .001.

## 5. Discussion Questions
	1.	What does the negative t-value indicate?
	2.	What would happen if the sample were larger but had the same mean?
	3.	How does the confidence interval help confirm your conclusion?
	4.	Can a non-significant result still be meaningful? Why or why not?

## 6. Optional Extension
	•	Effect Size: Calculate Cohen’s d manually or using:

```{r}
(mean(sleep_data$sleep_hours) - 8) / sd(sleep_data$sleep_hours)
```

	•	Visualization: Show how the sample mean compares to the population mean with a density plot or boxplot.

## Deliverable

A short lab report (or RMarkdown/Quarto doc) including:
	1.	Stated hypotheses
	2.	Output and interpretation
	3.	APA-style results section
	4.	Visual (optional)
	5.	Reflection question: “What does your result suggest about your sample?”
