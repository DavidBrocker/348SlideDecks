# Short Answer Questions (9-12)

## Question 9

What is the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression?

## Question 9

What is the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression?

> Answer: Simple linear regression uses one independent variable to predict the dependent variable, while multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables.

## Question 10

Describe the difference between correlation and causation. Why is it important not to infer causation directly from correlation?

::: fragment
> Answer: Correlation refers to a relationship or association between two variables, while causation indicates that one variable directly affects another. It is important not to infer causation from correlation because there may be confounding variables or the relationship may be coincidental.

## Question 11

Suppose you perform a regression analysis and the p-value of one of your predictors is 0.15. How would you interpret this result? Should you include this predictor in your model?

::: fragment
> Answer: A p-value of 0.15 suggests that the predictor is not statistically significant at conventional levels (e.g., 0.05). You may consider removing this predictor, though you might keep it if there is theoretical justification

# Problem-Solving/Interpretation Questions (12-15)

## Question 12

A researcher collects data on study hours and exam scores and finds a correlation coefficient of r = 0.65.

-   What does this tell you about the relationship between study hours and exam scores?

-   Would you expect the relationship to be strong, moderate, or weak? Why?

## Question 12

### Answer

A researcher collects data on study hours and exam scores and finds a correlation coefficient of r = 0.65.

-   What does this tell you about the relationship between study hours and exam scores?
    -   A correlation of r = 0.65 indicates a positive and moderate relationship. As study hours increase, exam scores tend to increase, but the relationship is not perfect.
-   Would you expect the relationship to be strong, moderate, or weak? Why?
    -   The relationship would be considered moderate because the correlation is between 0.5 and 0.7, indicating a noticeable but not perfect relationship.

## Question 13

You run a simple linear regression analysis and get the following equation:

$\hat{Y} = 2.5 + 1.8X$

-   What is the predicted value of Y if X is 4?

-   What does the coefficient 1.8 represent in this context?

## Question 13

### Answer

$\hat{Y} = 2.5 + 1.8X$

-   What is the predicted value of Y if X is 4?

$\hat{Y} = 2.5 + 1.8(4) = 2.5 + 7.2 = 9.7$

-   What does the coefficient 1.8 represent in this context?

    -   The coefficient `1.8` represents the predicted change in Y for each additional unit of X. In this context, it means that for each additional unit of X, Y is expected to increase by `1.8` units.

## Question 14

Consider the output of a regression analysis where the R-squared value is 0.70 and the coefficient of the independent variable is 3.2 with a p-value of 0.02.

-   Interpret the R-squared value in terms of the model’s explanatory power.

-   Based on the coefficient and p-value, would you consider this predictor variable significant? Why or why not?

## Question 14

### Answer

Consider the output of a regression analysis where the R-squared value is 0.70 and the coefficient of the independent variable is 3.2 with a p-value of 0.02.

-   Interpret the R-squared value in terms of the model’s explanatory power.
    -   <div>

        > Answer: An R-squared value of 0.70 means that 70% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model.

        </div>
-   Based on the coefficient and p-value, would you consider this predictor variable significant? Why or why not?
    -   <div>

        > Answer: Yes, the predictor is significant. The p-value of 0.02 is less than 0.05, indicating that the predictor variable is statistically significant at the 5% level.

        </div>
