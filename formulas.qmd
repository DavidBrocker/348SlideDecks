## Measures of Central Tendency

### Arithmetic Mean

$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum(x)}{n}$

## Measures of Dispersion
### Sample Variance

$s^2 = \frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$

### Sample Standard Deviation
$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$

### Z-Score
$z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}$

## Correlation and Covariance

$r = \frac{\sum(X-\bar{X})(Y-\bar{Y})}{(s_x)(s_y)(N-1)}$

## Inferential Statistics
### Single Sample T-Test

$t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\sigma_{\bar{x}}}$

- $t$  = The t-statistic, representing how far the sample mean is from the population mean (in standard error units).

- $\bar{X}$  = The sample mean of your data.

- $\mu_0$  = The hypothesized population mean (the value youâ€™re comparing your sample to).

- $\sigma_{\bar{X}}$  = The standard error of the mean, calculated as:

    - $\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$


### Paired-Samples T-Test

$t = \frac{\bar{D}}{\sigma_{\bar{D}}}$

- $\bar{D}$ = Mean difference between T1 and T2

- $\sigma_{\bar{D}}$ = Standard Error of the mean difference

    - $\frac{\sigma_{\bar{D}}}{n}$

### Independent-Samples T-Test
$t = \frac{\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{N_1}-\frac{s^2_2}{N_2}}}$

- $t$  = The t-statistic, representing how far apart the two sample means are, relative to the variability in the data.

- $\bar{X}_1$  and  $\bar{X}_2$  = The means of the two independent samples (Group 1 and Group 2).

- $s_1^2$  and  $s_2^2$  = The sample variances of the two groups.

- $n_1$  and  $n_2$  = The sample sizes of the two groups.

### One-Way ANOVA (Between)

$F = \frac{MS_{\text{between}}}{MS_{\text{within}}} = \frac{\frac{SS_{\text{between}}}{df_{\text{between}}}}{\frac{SS_{\text{within}}}{df_{\text{within}}}}$

- $F$  = Test statistic for the ANOVA

- $MS_{between}$  = Mean Square Between Groups

- $MS_{within}$  = Mean Square Within Groups (also called Error)

- $SS_{between}$  = Sum of Squares Between Groups

- $SS_{within}$  = Sum of Squares Within Groups

- $df_{between}$  = Degrees of Freedom Between Groups

- $df_{within}$  = Degrees of Freedom Within Groups
