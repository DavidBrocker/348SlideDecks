-   What is a parameter?

    -   Information that describes the population.

-   What is a statistic?

    -   Information that describes the sample.

    -   Inferences about the population based on information from the sample.
:::

## **Descriptive Statistics**

### Describe the characteristics of the sample.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Think about our data on time spent on Instagram.

-   How could we describe it?

    -   Average

    -   Min & Max
:::

## **Descriptive Statistics**

### Describe the characteristics of a sample in terms of:

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Central tendency: What most people said

-   Dispersion: How spread out the data are
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Tell us about the mid-point (center) of a distribution.

-   Tell us about the mid-point (center) of a distribution.

-   Tell us most participants' answer.
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Mean

    -   the average; obtained by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.

    -   $\sum^{n}_{i=1} = x_1 + x_2...$
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Median

    -   The middle number; obtained by ordering all values from lowest to highest and taking the middle (if n is odd or the average of the 2 middle if n is even)
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Mode

    -   the most frequent answer; obtained by counting how many times each answer is given and taking the value that occurs most often
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### Standard Normal Distribution

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
x <- seq(5, 15, length=1000)

y <- dnorm(x, mean=10, sd=1)

nm <- data.frame(x,y)

ggplot(data = nm, aes(x,y)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 10) +
  geom_label(label = "Mean", y = 0, x = 10) +
  geom_label(label = "Median", y = 0.15, x = 10) +
  geom_label(label = "Mode", y = 0.3, x = 10)
  
```

## **Measures of Central tendency**

In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal to one another.

Mean = Median = Mode

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### The Mean is good for use in normal distributions

```{r}
 
  data.frame(
    z = rnorm(500,30,sd =10)
    ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(z)) + 
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 10
  ) + 
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = "",
         y = "")
```

## **The Mean**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   The mean is only helpful in a [**normal distribution**]{.underline}, which you may have heard called a normal curve or bell curve.

-   We overwhelmingly use the mean, because in the social and behavioral sciences, we nearly always assume the distribution is normal.
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### When should we use the median...

A skewed distribution occurs when one side of the date gets cut off due to measurement limitation.

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate 1000 random values from a Beta distribution
left_skewed <- rbeta(1000, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5)

data.frame(left_skewed) |> 
  ggplot(aes(left_skewed)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "lightcoral") +
  labs(
    title = "Left-Skewed Distribution",
    x = "",
    y = ""
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 
               median(left_skewed)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 
               mean(left_skewed)) 
```

## **The Median**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   In a skewed distribution, the mean gets pulled out toward the tail, and the mode gets pulled to the cluster.

-   The median is the best measure of central tendency for skewed distributions because it tells us how most people answered.
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### **The Mode**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   The mode is good for bi-or-tri-modal distributions.

-   When might you have a bi-modal distribution?
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### **The Mode**

```{r}
exam <- 
  data.frame(
    l = c(rnorm(500,80,1),
          rnorm(500,65,1))
  )

ggplot(exam,aes(l)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "",
    title = "When half of the class scores high and the other half doesn't"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 65,
             color = "red") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 80,
             color = "red") +
  theme(
    plot.title = 
      element_text(
        size = 20, 
        face = "bold")
  )
```

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### **The Mode**

```{r}
exam <- 
  data.frame(l = c(
    rnorm(500,1,0.5), 
    rnorm(500,5,0.5)) 
    )

ggplot(exam, aes(l)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "maroon") +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = "", 
       title = "When half the class loves something and the other class hates it!",
       subtitle = "On a scale of 1-7, how much do you like Professor Brocker's jokes?") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = 
      element_text(
        size = 20, 
        face = "bold")
    )
```

## When should we use...

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Mean

    -   good for normal distributions

-   Median

    -   good for skewed distributions

-   Mode

    -   good for bimodal distributions
:::

## **Central tendency: Which should we use?**

### Two or More Peaks

```{r}
  data.frame(l = c(
    rnorm(500,1,0.5), 
    rnorm(500,5,0.5)) 
    ) |> 
ggplot(aes(l)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkblue") +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = ""
       ) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

## **Central tendency: Which should we use?**

### Slide to the Left!

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate 1000 random values from a Beta distribution
left_skewed <- rbeta(1000, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5)

data.frame(left_skewed) |> 
  ggplot(aes(left_skewed)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "grey30") +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = ""
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() 
```

## **Central tendency: Which should we use?**

### Looks Normal to Me

```{r}
  
data.frame(
  l = rnorm(500,12,1)
    ) |> 
ggplot(aes(l)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkorange") +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = ""
       ) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

## **Measures of Central tendency:**

### **The mean**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   We use the mean most often in social science, because many of our statistical tests can only be used on normal distributions.

-   We *assume* normality of the distribution, and use the mean.
:::

## Calculating measures of central tendency

### **Calculating The mean**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Sum all x values

-   Divide by the number of x values (n).
:::

. . .

`x = 4,2,5,6`

. . .

$\frac{\Sigma(x)}{n}$

. . .

$\Sigma(x) = 4 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 17$

. . .

$\frac{17}{4} = 4.25$

## Calculating measures of central tendency

## **Calculating The median**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Put all x values in order from smallest or largest or largest to smallest.

-   Find the middle number.

-   If there are an even number of x values, take the average of the 2 middle numbers.

-   `x = 4,2,5,6,3`

-   `x = 2,3,4,5,6`
:::

## Calculating measures of central tendency

### **Calculating The mode**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Put all x values in order from smallest or largest or largest to smallest. $x = [3,2,1,5,3,7,8,3,2,4,1]$

-   Find the number or numbers that repeat the most. $x = [1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,5,7,8]$

-   There can be more than 1 mode.
