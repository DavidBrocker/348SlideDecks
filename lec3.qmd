## Studying Psychology

### The Bobo Doll Experiment (Bandura, 1961)

### ![](images/bobo.png)

## Studying Psychology

### Defining Variables

-   Operationalization

    -   The process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon that is not directly measurable (AKA a latent variable) though its existence is implied by other phenomena.

# How could we measure happiness? {style="text-align: center;"}

[mood]{.material-icons style="font-size: 4em;"}

## Operationalization

### Figuring out how to measure something you can't directly measure.

-   Attitudes

-   Beliefs

-   Thoughts

-   Behaviors

-   Brain activity

-   Performance/Abilities

# What if I wanted to measure disgust? {style="text-align: center;"}

{{< fa face-grin-tongue-squint size=5x >}}

## Operationalization

### Types of Measurements

-   Self-Report or Behavioral Measures

-   Observation

-   Implicit Measures

-   Tests

## Types of Measurements

### Self-report

-   Surveys

-   Questionnaires

-   Polls

-   Quizzes

-   Instruments

## Self-Report

### What's wrong with this?

```

## Self-Report:

### Advantages

-   Most popular method of assessing attitudes

-   Can obtain large amounts of data

    -   (Fairly) Quick

-   Allows for adaptive testing

    -   (Fairly) Inexpensive

## Self-Report:

### Disadvantages

-   Acquiescence

    -   Tendency to say yes, true, agree

-   Social desirability

    -   Tendency to respond in ways that are seen as socially acceptable

-   Demand characteristics

    -   Tendency to response in ways that participant thinks researcher wants

## Self-Report:

### Avoiding Disadvantages

-   Anonymous respondents are less likely to make things up

    -   Assure anonymity

-   Allow respondents to answer in private

    -   Allow for maximum privacy

-   Don't make your experiment too obvious/revealing

    -   Obscure the true goal of the experiment

-   Add questions that test for respondent awareness

    -   Include attention checks

-   Purposely make some questions opposite

    -   Reverse coding

## Behavioral Measures

### Examples

-   Taking a flier

-   Signing a petition

-   Internet Behavior

-   Moving a chair

-   Donating money

## Observation

### The Bobo Doll Experiment (Bandura, 1961)

### ![](images/bobo.png)

## The Bobo Doll Experiment

### (Bandura, 1961)

-   Live aggression by adult

-   Videotaped aggression by adult

-   Cartoon aggression

    -   No aggression

## Observation

### Disadvantages

-   Time consuming

-   Different reviewers/observers may score behaviors differently.

    -   Coding scheme

        -   *Who* decides what is an example of the behavior?

    -   Inter-rater Reliability

        -   How much *agreement* is there between 2+ observers?

## Implicit measures

### Brain activity

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

    -   Neuroimaging of brain activity

        ![](images/fmri.png){width="259"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Electroencephalography (EEG)

    -   Electrodes on surface of scalp measures brain activity

        ![](images/eeg.png){width="291"}
:::
:::::

## Issues with Operationalization

### Why is it hard to measure psychological phenomena?

-   Others may choose to measure the phenomena differently from us

-   Operationalization can be culture-specific

-   What we measure is based on observable parts of the phenomena, but some parts may not be able to be observed

    -   Measuring only the observable is imprecise

# How else could Bandura have measured aggression? {style="text-align: center;"}

<i class="fa-solid fa-face-angry fa-5x fa-bounce"></i>

## Operationalization

### How should we measure aggression in children?

-   Observe children for one hour and...

    -   **Label** them as Aggressive or Non-Aggressive

    -   **Rank** them from most aggressive to least aggressive

    -   **Score** them on a 10-point scale.

        -   1 = No Aggression

        -   10 = All of the Aggression

    -   **Count** number of aggressive behaviors

## Scales of measurement

### A Scale By Any Other Name

-   ~~**Labels**~~ Nominal

-   ~~**Rank**~~ Order

-   ~~**Scale**~~ Interval

-   ~~**Count**~~ Ratio

## Nominal (Categories, No Order)

-   Type of therapy (CBT, psychoanalysis, EMDR)
-   Diagnosis (Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, none)
-   Relationship status (single, dating, married, divorced)
-   Coffee drinker vs. non-coffee drinker

# Raise your hand if you’re a coffee drinker, tea drinker, or energy-drink person. That’s nominal data. {style="text-align: center;"}

{{< fa mug-hot size=5x >}}

## Ordinal (Ranked, Uneven Gaps)

### Examples:

-   Rank order of stress: mild / moderate / severe
-   Olympic medals (gold, silver, bronze)
-   Likert-style agreement (Strongly Disagree → Strongly Agree) — though technically often treated as interval in practice
-   Clinical severity ratings (minimal, mild, moderate, severe depression)

# Who’s seen the movie *Inside Out*? Imagine ranking the emotions in order of how often you feel them—Fear first, then Joy, then Anger. That’s ordinal. {style="text-align: center;"}

{{< fa face-smile size=5x >}}

## Interval (equal distances, no true zero)

### Examples:

-   IQ scores

-   Standardized test scores (e.g., SAT, GRE)

-   Temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius

-   GPA

# If someone has a GPA of 0.0, does that mean they don’t exist as a student? No—it just means they failed. That’s why GPA is interval, not ratio. {style="text-align: center;"}

{{< fa file-lines size=5x >}}

## Ratio (equal distances, true zero)

### Examples:

-   Reaction time (can be 0 ms)

-   Number of therapy sessions attended

-   Cortisol level in blood

-   Hours of sleep last night

-   Money donated to a cause

# How many hours of sleep did you get last night? If you got 0, that really means 0. Ratio scale. {style="text-align: center;"}

{{< fa bed size=5x >}}

## Interval vs Ratio

### What's the difference between interval and ratio?

-   Interval may have a 0 on the scale, but it doesn't mean the absence of something. A 0.0 GPA means an F rather than the absence of a grade.

-   Ratio has a 0 that. means 0 (the absence of something), like a '0' as a response to the questions, "How many drinks did you have last night?"

## Discrete and Continuous

### What's the Difference?

```{=html}
<iframe class = slide-deck src="https://farmingdale.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8BmvWRKoN0pX36e" width="100%" height="50%"></iframe>
```

## Discrete and Continuous

### Discrete variables have predefined values

-   **Number of siblings** (you can’t have 2.5 siblings)

-   **Number of errors on a test**

-   **Types of therapy** (CBT, psychoanalysis, none)

-   **Diagnostic category** (depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc.)

-   **Eye color**

-   **Number of cups of coffee consumed today**

## Discrete and Continuous

### Continuous Variables can occupy several different values

-   **Reaction time** (seconds, milliseconds)

-   **Height** (inches, centimeters)

-   **Weight** (pounds, kilograms)

-   **Self-esteem score** on a 1–10 scale

-   **GPA**

-   **Hours of sleep last night** (can be 7.25 hours)

-   **Brain activity** (EEG voltage, fMRI signal intensity)

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

> Undergraduates report their self-esteem on a scale of 1 to 10. Researchers assess the relationship of undergraduates’ self-esteem and GPA.

-   Predictor variable: **Self-Esteem** \| [Continuous (Interval)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

-   Outcome variable: **GPA** \| [Continuous (Interval)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

> Participants are given a mystery drug or placebo and then asked to complete puzzle tasks. Researchers time how long participants take to complete the puzzles.

-   Independent variable: Drug vs. Placebo \| [Categorical (Nominal)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

-   Dependent variable: Reaction Time \| [Continuous (Ratio)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

> Undergraduates are shown either pictures of death or pictures of landscapes. They then report their anxiety about aging on a scale of 1 (none) to 10 (lots).

-   Independent variable: Pictures of death versus landscapes \| [Categorical (Nominal)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

-   Dependent variable: Anxiety about dying \| [Continuous (Interval)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

## Why does scale of measurement matter?

### For Science!

-   Statistical tests can only be run on specific scales of measurement.

-   t-test & ANOVA: Nominal IV/predictor and Continuous DV/outcome

-   Correlation & Regression: All continuous

## Why does scale of measurement matter?

-   Generally, continuous variables (interval and ratio scales) lend themselves better to statistical analysis.

-   As a researcher, you should plan out your statistical analysis BEFORE conducting your study, so that you measure your variables in a way that matches the type of analyses you will run.

## Takeaway: *How* we measure variables matters...

### because it dictates what kind of statistical analyses we can run.

-   Data can be coerced into different formats

-   'Correct' or 'Supporting' results can come from bogus data

-   We’ve measured aggression/self-esteem/attention. Now, how do we summarize all these numbers?

## Statistical Terms & Symbols

## Statistical Symbols

### Case-sensitive and often Greek

-   $n$ = the number of people in the sample

-   $x$ = one datapoint in a sample

-   $\bar{x}$ = Arithmetic mean (average) for a sample, x

-   $\Sigma(x)$ = The sum of all values in a sample, x

-   $\sum^{n}_{i = 1}= x_1 +x_2+x_3...$

## Practice 1

### Study Up!

> Esmeralda is taking Statistics for the Psychological Sciences. On her first exam, she scored 98. The average grade among the 26 students on that exam was 97

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### Standard Normal Distribution

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

x <- seq(5, 15, length=1000)

y <- dnorm(x, mean=10, sd=1)

nm <- data.frame(x,y)

ggplot(data = nm, aes(x,y)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 10) +
  geom_label(label = "Mean", y = 0, x = 10) +
  geom_label(label = "Median", y = 0.15, x = 10) +
  geom_label(label = "Mode", y = 0.3, x = 10)
  
```

## **Measures of Central tendency**

In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal to one another.

Mean = Median = Mode

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### The Mean is good for use in normal distributions

```{r}
 
  data.frame(
    z = rnorm(500,30,sd =10)
    ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(z)) + 
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 10
  ) + 
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = "",
         y = "")
```

## **The Mean**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   The mean is only helpful in a [**normal distribution**]{.underline}, which you may have heard called a normal curve or bell curve.

-   We overwhelmingly use the mean, because in the social and behavioral sciences, we nearly always assume the distribution is normal.
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### When should we use the median...

A skewed distribution occurs when one side of the date gets cut off due to measurement limitation.

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate 1000 random values from a Beta distribution
left_skewed <- rbeta(1000, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5)

data.frame(left_skewed) |> 
  ggplot(aes(left_skewed)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "lightcoral") +
  labs(
    title = "Left-Skewed Distribution",
    x = "",
    y = ""
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 
               median(left_skewed)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 
               mean(left_skewed)) 
```

## **The Median**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   In a skewed distribution, the mean gets pulled out toward the tail, and the mode gets pulled to the cluster.

-   The median is the best measure of central tendency for skewed distributions because it tells us how most people answered.
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### **The Mode**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   The mode is good for bi-or-tri-modal distributions.

-   When might you have a bi-modal distribution?
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### **The Mode**

```{r}
exam <- 
  data.frame(
    l = c(rnorm(500,80,1),
          rnorm(500,65,1))
  )

ggplot(exam,aes(l)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "",
    title = "When half of the class scores high and the other half doesn't"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 65,
             color = "red") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 80,
             color = "red") +
  theme(
    plot.title = 
      element_text(
        size = 20, 
        face = "bold")
  )
```

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### **The Mode**

```{r}
exam <- 
  data.frame(l = c(
    rnorm(500,1,0.5), 
    rnorm(500,5,0.5)) 
    )

ggplot(exam, aes(l)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "maroon") +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = "", 
       title = "When half the class loves something and the other class hates it!",
       subtitle = "On a scale of 1-7, how much do you like Professor Brocker's jokes?") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = 
      element_text(
        size = 20, 
        face = "bold")
    )
```

## When should we use...

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Mean

    -   good for normal distributions

-   Median

    -   good for skewed distributions

-   Mode

    -   good for bimodal distributions
:::

## **Central tendency: Which should we use?**

### Two or More Peaks

```{r}
  data.frame(l = c(
    rnorm(500,1,0.5), 
    rnorm(500,5,0.5)) 
    ) |> 
ggplot(aes(l)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkblue") +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = ""
       ) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

## **Central tendency: Which should we use?**

### Slide to the Left!

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate 1000 random values from a Beta distribution
left_skewed <- rbeta(1000, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5)

data.frame(left_skewed) |> 
  ggplot(aes(left_skewed)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "grey30") +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = ""
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() 
```

## **Central tendency: Which should we use?**

### Looks Normal to Me

```{r}
  
data.frame(
  l = rnorm(500,12,1)
    ) |> 
ggplot(aes(l)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkorange") +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = ""
       ) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

## **Measures of Central tendency:**

### **The mean**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   We use the mean most often in social science, because many of our statistical tests can only be used on normal distributions.

-   We *assume* normality of the distribution, and use the mean.
:::

## Calculating measures of central tendency

### **Calculating The mean**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Sum all x values

-   Divide by the number of x values (n).
:::

. . .

`x = 4,2,5,6`

. . .

$\frac{\Sigma(x)}{n}$

. . .

$\Sigma(x) = 4 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 17$

. . .

$\frac{17}{4} = 4.25$

## Calculating measures of central tendency

## **Calculating The median**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Put all x values in order from smallest or largest or largest to smallest.

-   Find the middle number.

-   If there are an even number of x values, take the average of the 2 middle numbers.

-   `x = 4,2,5,6,3`

-   `x = 2,3,4,5,6`
:::

## Calculating measures of central tendency

### **Calculating The mode**

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
-   Put all x values in order from smallest or largest or largest to smallest. $x = [3,2,1,5,3,7,8,3,2,4,1]$

-   Find the number or numbers that repeat the most. $x = [1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,5,7,8]$

-   There can be more than 1 mode.

## **Review**

When are the mean, median, and mode the same (equal to one another)?

## **Key Takeaways Slide**

-   **Mean** → good for symmetric/normal.

-   **Median** → good for skewed/outlier-heavy.

-   **Mode** → good for categorical or multi-modal

-   We assume normality a lot because it lets us use the mean.
