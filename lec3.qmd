[Measures of Central Tendency]

## Studying Psychology

### The Bobo Doll Experiment (Bandura, 1961)

### ![](images/bobo.png)

## Studying Psychology

### Defining Variables

-   Operationalization

    -   The process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon that is not directly measurable (AKA a latent variable) though its existence is implied by other phenomena.

# How could we measure happiness? {style="text-align: center;"}

[mood]{.material-icons style="font-size: 4em;"}

## Operationalization

### Figuring out how to measure something you can't directly measure.

-   Attitudes

-   Beliefs

-   Thoughts

-   Behaviors

-   Brain activity

-   Performance/Abilities

# What if I wanted to measure disgust? {style="text-align: center;"}

{{< fa face-grin-tongue-squint size=5x >}}

## Operationalization

### Types of Measurements

-   Self-Report or Behavioral Measures

-   Observation

-   Implicit Measures

-   Tests

## Types of Measurements

### Self-report

-   Surveys

-   Questionnaires

-   Polls

-   Quizzes

-   Instruments

## Self-Report

### What's wrong with this?

```{=html}
<iframe class = slide-deck src="https://farmingdale.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8BmvWRKoN0pX36e" width="100%" height="50%"></iframe>
```

## Self-Report:

### Advantages

-   Most popular method of assessing attitudes

-   Can obtain large amounts of data

    -   (Fairly) Quick

-   Allows for adaptive testing

    -   (Fairly) Inexpensive

## Self-Report:

### Disadvantages

-   Acquiescence

    -   Tendency to say yes, true, agree

-   Social desirability

    -   Tendency to respond in ways that are seen as socially acceptable

-   Demand characteristics

    -   Tendency to response in ways that participant thinks researcher wants

## Self-Report:

### Avoiding Disadvantages

-   Anonymous respondents are less likely to make things up

    -   Assure anonymity

-   Allow respondents to answer in private

    -   Allow for maximum privacy

-   Don't make your experiment too obvious/revealing

    -   Obscure the true goal of the experiment

-   Add questions that test for respondent awareness

    -   Include attention checks

-   Purposely make some questions opposite

    -   Reverse coding

## Behavioral Measures

### Examples

-   Taking a flier

-   Signing a petition

-   Internet Behavior

-   Moving a chair

-   Donating money

## Observation

### The Bobo Doll Experiment (Bandura, 1961)

### ![](images/bobo.png)

## The Bobo Doll Experiment

### (Bandura, 1961)

-   Live aggression by adult

-   Videotaped aggression by adult

-   Cartoon aggression

    -   No aggression

## Observation

### Disadvantages

-   Time consuming

-   Different reviewers/observers may score behaviors differently.

    -   Coding scheme

        -   *Who* decides what is an example of the behavior?

    -   Inter-rater Reliability

        -   How much *agreement* is there between 2+ observers?

## Implicit measures

### Brain activity

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

    -   Neuroimaging of brain activity

        ![](images/fmri.png){width="259"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Electroencephalography (EEG)

    -   Electrodes on surface of scalp measures brain activity

        ![](images/eeg.png){width="291"}
:::
:::::

## Issues with Operationalization

### Why is it hard to measure psychological phenomena?

-   Others may choose to measure the phenomena differently from us

-   Operationalization can be culture-specific

-   What we measure is based on observable parts of the phenomena, but some parts may not be able to be observed

    -   Measuring only the observable is imprecise

# How else could Bandura have measured aggression? {style="text-align: center;"}

<i class="fa-solid fa-face-angry fa-5x fa-bounce"></i>

## Operationalization

### How should we measure aggression in children?

-   Observe children for one hour and...

    -   **Label** them as Aggressive or Non-Aggressive

    -   **Rank** them from most aggressive to least aggressive

    -   **Score** them on a 10-point scale.

        -   1 = No Aggression

        -   10 = All of the Aggression

    -   **Count** number of aggressive behaviors

## Scales of measurement

### A Scale By Any Other Name

-   ~~**Labels**~~ Nominal

-   ~~**Rank**~~ Order

-   ~~**Scale**~~ Interval

-   ~~**Count**~~ Ratio

## Nominal (Categories, No Order)

-   Type of therapy (CBT, psychoanalysis, EMDR)
-   Diagnosis (Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, none)
-   Relationship status (single, dating, married, divorced)
-   Coffee drinker vs. non-coffee drinker

# Raise your hand if you’re a coffee drinker, tea drinker, or energy-drink person. That’s nominal data. {style="text-align: center;"}

{{< fa mug-hot size=5x >}}

## Ordinal (Ranked, Uneven Gaps)

### Examples:

-   Rank order of stress: mild / moderate / severe
-   Olympic medals (gold, silver, bronze)
-   Likert-style agreement (Strongly Disagree → Strongly Agree) — though technically often treated as interval in practice
-   Clinical severity ratings (minimal, mild, moderate, severe depression)

# Who’s seen the movie *Inside Out*? Imagine ranking the emotions in order of how often you feel them—Fear first, then Joy, then Anger. That’s ordinal. {style="text-align: center;"}

{{< fa face-smile size=5x >}}

## Interval (equal distances, no true zero)

### Examples:

-   IQ scores

-   Standardized test scores (e.g., SAT, GRE)

-   Temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius

-   GPA

# If someone has a GPA of 0.0, does that mean they don’t exist as a student? No—it just means they failed. That’s why GPA is interval, not ratio. {style="text-align: center;"}

{{< fa file-lines size=5x >}}

## Ratio (equal distances, true zero)

### Examples:

-   Reaction time (can be 0 ms)

-   Number of therapy sessions attended

-   Cortisol level in blood

-   Hours of sleep last night

-   Money donated to a cause

# How many hours of sleep did you get last night? If you got 0, that really means 0. Ratio scale. {style="text-align: center;"}

{{< fa bed size=5x >}}

## Interval vs Ratio

### What's the difference between interval and ratio?

-   Interval may have a 0 on the scale, but it doesn't mean the absence of something. A 0.0 GPA means an F rather than the absence of a grade.

-   Ratio has a 0 that. means 0 (the absence of something), like a '0' as a response to the questions, "How many drinks did you have last night?"

## Discrete and Continuous

### What's the Difference?

```{=html}
<iframe class = slide-deck src="https://farmingdale.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8BmvWRKoN0pX36e" width="100%" height="50%"></iframe>
```

## Discrete and Continuous

### Discrete variables have predefined values

-   **Number of siblings** (you can’t have 2.5 siblings)

-   **Number of errors on a test**

-   **Types of therapy** (CBT, psychoanalysis, none)

-   **Diagnostic category** (depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc.)

-   **Eye color**

-   **Number of cups of coffee consumed today**

## Discrete and Continuous

### Continuous Variables can occupy several different values

-   **Reaction time** (seconds, milliseconds)

-   **Height** (inches, centimeters)

-   **Weight** (pounds, kilograms)

-   **Self-esteem score** on a 1–10 scale

-   **GPA**

-   **Hours of sleep last night** (can be 7.25 hours)

-   **Brain activity** (EEG voltage, fMRI signal intensity)

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

> Undergraduates report their self-esteem on a scale of 1 to 10. Researchers assess the relationship of undergraduates’ self-esteem and GPA.

-   Predictor variable: **Self-Esteem** \| [Continuous (Interval)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

-   Outcome variable: **GPA** \| [Continuous (Interval)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

> Participants are given a mystery drug or placebo and then asked to complete puzzle tasks. Researchers time how long participants take to complete the puzzles.

-   Independent variable: Drug vs. Placebo \| [Categorical (Nominal)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

-   Dependent variable: Reaction Time \| [Continuous (Ratio)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

> Undergraduates are shown either pictures of death or pictures of landscapes. They then report their anxiety about aging on a scale of 1 (none) to 10 (lots).

-   Independent variable: Pictures of death versus landscapes \| [Categorical (Nominal)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

-   Dependent variable: Anxiety about dying \| [Continuous (Interval)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

## Why does scale of measurement matter?

### For Science!

-   Statistical tests can only be run on specific scales of measurement.

-   t-test & ANOVA: Nominal IV/predictor and Continuous DV/outcome

-   Correlation & Regression: All continuous

## Why does scale of measurement matter?

-   Generally, continuous variables (interval and ratio scales) lend themselves better to statistical analysis.

-   As a researcher, you should plan out your statistical analysis BEFORE conducting your study, so that you measure your variables in a way that matches the type of analyses you will run.

## Takeaway: *How* we measure variables matters...

### because it dictates what kind of statistical analyses we can run.

-   Data can be coerced into different formats

-   'Correct' or 'Supporting' results can come from bogus data

-   We’ve measured aggression/self-esteem/attention. Now, how do we summarize all these numbers?

## Statistical Terms & Symbols

![](https://media.tenor.com/CowGNQSUsOYAAAAM/confused-math.gif){fig-align="center" width="632"}

## Statistical Symbols

### Case-sensitive and often Greek

-   $n$ = the number of people in the sample

-   $x$ = one datapoint in a sample

-   $\bar{x}$ = Arithmetic mean (average) for a sample, x

-   $\Sigma(x)$ = The sum of all values in a sample, x

-   $\sum^{n}_{i = 1}= x_1 +x_2+x_3...$

## Practice 1

### Study Up!

> Esmeralda is taking Statistics for the Psychological Sciences. On her first exam, she scored 98. The average grade among the 26 students on that exam was 97

-   n:

-   x:

-   $\bar{x}$:

-   $\large{\sum^{n}_{i=1} = x_1 + x_2...}$

-   $\large{\frac{\sum(x)}{n}}$

-   $\large{[3,4,5,2,1] = \frac{\sum(3+4+5+2+1)}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = \bar{x} = 3}$
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### Median

::: callout-important
-   The middle number; obtained by ordering all values from lowest to highest and taking the middle (if n is odd or the average of the 2 middle if n is even)

-   $\large{x = \{4,2,5,6,3\}}$

-   $\large{x = \{2,3,4,5,6\}}$

-   $\large{x = \{2,3,\color{blue}{4},5,6\}}$
:::

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### Mode

::: callout-important

## **Measures of Central tendency**

### When should we use the median...

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   A skewed distribution occurs when one side of the data gets cut off due to measurement limitation.

-   In a skewed distribution, the mean gets pulled out toward the tail, and the mode gets pulled to the cluster.

-   The median is the best measure of central tendency for skewed distributions because it tells us how most people answered.

## **Review**

### When do we use the and how do we caluclate the...

-   Mean?

-   Median?

-   Mode?

## **Key Takeaways Slide**

-   **Mean** → good for symmetric/normal.

-   **Median** → good for skewed/outlier-heavy.

-   **Mode** → good for categorical or multi-modal

-   We assume normality because it lets us use the mean.
